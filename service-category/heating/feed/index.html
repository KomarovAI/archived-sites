<p>Our highly trained technicians will address any issue with your gas or electric furnace.&nbsp;We’ll&nbsp;quickly diagnose the problem, provide you with honest recommendations, and then get to work restoring your home’s heat.&nbsp;Read on to learn more about our services and discover why we’re the go-to choice for furnace repair in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.callmedley.com/service-area/">Carrollton and surrounding areas</a>.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Signs Your Furnace Requires Repair</h3>



<p>It’s not always obvious when your furnace&nbsp;requires&nbsp;repair.&nbsp;Knowing the signs to look out for helps you catch the problem early on and prevent it from progressing.&nbsp;We recommend that you call us for furnace repairs if:&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Your furnace isn’t producing heat:</strong> If your furnace is blowing cold or lukewarm air, you may have a duct leak or broken thermostat. Our team will quickly identify and repair the issue to restore your home to a comfortable temperature.</li>



<li><strong>Your furnace makes </strong><strong>strange noises</strong><strong>:</strong> When you turn your furnace on, you shouldn’t hear anything other than fans and air. If you hear any bangs or other unexpected noises, call us to get it fixed fast.</li>



<li><strong>Your furnace turns off and on </strong><strong>constantly</strong><strong>:</strong> If your heating system clicks off and on continuously, there is likely a problem with the thermostat, filter, or ductwork that requires professional repairs. </li>



<li><strong>You keep cranking the thermostat up to stay warm:</strong> If you have to continually turn up the thermostat to get the furnace to generate heat, there’s likely an underlying issue that requires repair.</li>



<li><strong>Strange smells coming from the unit: </strong>If you notice burning or other unpleasant smells coming from your furnace, there may be overheating components or electrical issues that require immediate repair.</li>



<li><strong>Your pilot light goes out:</strong> If you notice your furnace pilot light is out, contact one of our HVAC technicians. We’ll make sure there’s no underlying reason the light was extinguished and get it going again quickly.</li>



<li><strong>The pilot light is yellow instead of blue:</strong> A yellow pilot light could indicate a serious problem with your furnace, including a possible <a href="https://www.tdi.texas.gov/tips/how-to-avoid-carbon-monoxide-poisoning-at-home.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">carbon monoxide leak</a>. Immediately turn the furnace off, leave the area, and call our professionals for assistance. </li>
</ul>



<p>While&nbsp;some homeowners avoid furnace repair because they’re concerned about how much it will cost or how long it will take, it’s&nbsp;best&nbsp;to deal with these issues head-on.&nbsp;Timely repairs&nbsp;prevent the problem from worsening&nbsp;and save&nbsp;you&nbsp;money in the long run.</p>

<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Furnace Installation/Replacement in Carrollton</h1>



<p>If you’re&nbsp;considering&nbsp;installing a furnace, turn to the pros at Medley Heating, Air Conditioning &amp; Plumbing. We&nbsp;offer professional&nbsp;gas and electric heater&nbsp;installation&nbsp;for residents&nbsp;throughout Dallas and Collin Counties. Whether&nbsp;your unit is on its last legs&nbsp;or you want to upgrade to a&nbsp;new, more energy-efficient furnace,&nbsp;you can count on&nbsp;our team&nbsp;to&nbsp;get the job done quickly and correctly.</p>



<p><strong>Schedule your routine maintenance service today;&nbsp;</strong><a href="tel:4698874874"><strong>call Medley Heating, Air Conditioning &amp; Plumbing</strong></a><a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></a><a href="tel:4698874874"><strong>at (469) 887-4874</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://www.callmedley.com/contact-us/"><strong>contact us online</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;to get started.</strong></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Signs You Need a New Furnace</h3>



<p>Many homeowners aren’t&nbsp;aware of the signs their&nbsp;furnace needs to be replaced, which can lead to complete breakdowns and other major problems.&nbsp;Don’t wait until you&nbsp;lose heat altogether. Save yourself the hassle&nbsp;and act at the first sign of trouble.&nbsp;Some key indicators that&nbsp;it’s time to consider replacing your furnace include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Your furnace is old: </strong>Most furnaces last between 10 and 20 years. If your furnace is nearing the end of its lifespan, consider replacing it to ensure you and your family stay warm through the chilly Texas winters.</li>



<li><strong>Your furnace doesn’t heat as well as it used to: </strong>As your furnace ages, wear and tear results in reduced efficiency and airflow. If it no longer keeps up with your household’s demands, it may be time for a home heating upgrade.</li>



<li><strong>You have health concerns</strong>: An aging furnace allows more dust, debris, and allergens into your home, creating poor <a href="https://www.callmedley.com/indoor-air-quality/">indoor air quality</a>. It can also permit poisonous gasses, such as <a href="https://www.cpsc.gov/Safety-Education/Safety-Education-Centers/Carbon-Monoxide-Information-Center#:~:text=Know%20the%20symptoms%20of%20carbon,immediately%2C%20and%20then%20call%20911." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">carbon monoxide</a>, to enter the air if it malfunctions. If anyone in your household has health concerns and believes your furnace could be worsening symptoms, call us to discuss new furnace installation.</li>



<li><strong>Your furnace makes unusual noises:</strong> If you hear banging, popping, or other unusual noises, this can indicate that something has broken within your heating system. While repair may solve some issues, others require complete replacement. Our technicians will inspect your furnace and determine whether you need repairs or new installation.</li>



<li><strong>Your energy bills are rising: </strong>Over time, wear and tear causes your furnace to work harder to produce the same amount of heat. If you notice an unexpected spike in your utility bills, installing a new, high-efficiency furnace will help keep your energy usage down.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Choosing the Right Furnace for Your Home</h3>



<p>There are two main types of residential furnaces: gas and electric. The&nbsp;right&nbsp;furnace for your home depends on your comfort preferences, budget, and house size. In general, gas furnaces are more energy efficient than electric furnaces. They also heat homes more quickly and are cheaper to install. However, the upfront price of a new gas furnace is more than that of a new electric model, and&nbsp;they&nbsp;do pose some safety concerns. Electric furnaces tend to last longer than gas furnaces, meaning you could save money on HVAC replacement costs in the long run.</p>



<p>Our&nbsp;team at Medley Heating, Air Conditioning, and Plumbing will help you determine which type of furnace&nbsp;best suits&nbsp;your needs.&nbsp;We’re&nbsp;happy to answer any questions you may have and provide our personalized, professional recommendations. We never recommend any products we wouldn’t install in our own homes.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Our Furnace Installation Process</h3>



<p>At Medley, we handle every step of the&nbsp;HVAC installation process to provide a seamless experience from start to finish. We begin by assessing&nbsp;your space&nbsp;to&nbsp;determine the right type and size of furnace&nbsp;for&nbsp;your needs.&nbsp;We’ll consider your specific&nbsp;comfort needs, budget, and efficiency concerns&nbsp;to&nbsp;recommend high-quality products from some of the industry’s most trusted brands. Once&nbsp;you receive&nbsp;your new furnace,&nbsp;we’ll remove your old unit,&nbsp;carefully install it according to the manufacturer’s specifications, and test it to&nbsp;ensure&nbsp;everything&nbsp;works correctly&nbsp;before&nbsp;leaving.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Why Choose Medley for Furnace Installation &amp; Replacement</h3>
