<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Indoor Air Quality Services in Carrollton, TX</h1>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Improving the Comfort, Health &amp; Safety of Your Home</h3>



<p>Most people don’t realize that the quality of the air inside their homes can be just as bad—if not worse—than the air quality outside. The good news is that there are many ways to improve your indoor air quality and enjoy a better, healthier home.</p>



<p>At&nbsp;<a href="https://www.callmedley.com/about-us/">Medley Heating, Air Conditioning &amp; Plumbing</a>, we offer a range of indoor air quality solutions for homeowners throughout Dallas and Collin Counties. From top-of-the-line air purifiers to whole-home humidifiers, we can help you address a range of air quality and comfort concerns. Our highly trained technicians will assess your space, identify any issues, and provide their honest and professional recommendations based on their findings. We are happy to answer any questions you may have.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Importance of Indoor Air Quality Testing</h3>



<p>Over time, pollutants can collect in the air ducts and vents throughout your home. Contaminants like mold, mildew, bacteria, dust, and debris can be released into the air, leading to an array of health and safety concerns.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Poor indoor air quality has been associated with:</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Increased severity of asthma and allergy symptoms </li>



<li>Heightened risk of illness, including colds and respiratory problems</li>



<li>More frequent headaches, sore throat, and eye/nose irritation</li>



<li>Dizziness and nausea </li>
</ul>



<p>With prolonged exposure to poor indoor air quality, people are at risk of even more serious health conditions, such as respiratory illness, cardiovascular disease, developmental delays, and even cancer. Certain individuals—such as children, pregnant women, and the elderly—face an increased risk of serious health problems related to poor indoor air quality.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Indoor air quality tests are simple, effective, and non-invasive. At&nbsp;<a href="https://www.callmedley.com/">Medley Heating, Air Conditioning &amp; Plumbing</a>, we can quickly and easily assess your indoor air quality and tell you whether you should consider products or services to enhance the safety of your home. We can also help you create a customized indoor air quality plan to meet your specific needs, as well as the needs of your family.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How to Improve Your Indoor Air Quality</h3>



<p><strong>There are several ways to improve the quality of the air inside your home:&nbsp;</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Duct Cleaning: </strong>Regular <a href="https://www.callmedley.com/indoor-air-quality/">air duct cleaning</a> can significantly improve your indoor air quality. During our routine duct cleaning service, we thoroughly remove all dust, debris, pet dander, and other particles from inside the ducts, thereby preventing them from being spread around your home and into the air you and your family breathe. </li>



<li><strong>Installing Indoor Air Quality Equipment:</strong> There are various products to choose from when it comes to improving your home’s indoor air quality. At Medley Heating, Air Conditioning &amp; Plumbing, we offer top-quality systems from industry-leading brands, including <a href="https://www.callmedley.com/indoor-air-quality/uv-filtration-purification/">UV filtration and purification systems</a>, air purifiers, carbon monoxide detectors, and more. </li>



<li><strong>Installing a Whole-Home Humidifier/Dehumidifier: </strong>Humidity plays a large role in overall indoor air quality. Excess humidity can foster mold and mildew growth, whereas lack of humidity can lead to eye, nose, throat, and skin irritation, among other issues. A <a href="https://www.callmedley.com/indoor-air-quality/humidifiers-dehumidifiers/">whole-home humidifier/dehumidifier</a> can help combat this problem. </li>



<li><strong>Choose a Smart Thermostat: </strong>New “smart” <a href="https://www.callmedley.com/indoor-air-quality/thermostats/">thermostats</a> can not only help maintain optimal temperature levels throughout your home; they can also monitor indoor air quality and alert you when the air quality drops. We can help you find a thermostat that meets your needs. </li>
</ul>



<p>We want to help you find the&nbsp;<em>right&nbsp;</em>solution for your home. Get in touch with our team at Medley Heating, Air Conditioning &amp; Plumbing today to learn more about our indoor air quality services in Carrollton and how we can help you with your air quality concerns.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Choose the Indoor Air Quality Experts at Medley</h3>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Types of Indoor Air Quality Systems</strong></h3>



<p>When it comes to selecting an indoor air quality system, you have several options to choose from. Different types of systems offer different results; finding the right equipment for your home depends on your unique health and comfort concerns.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Some of the different types of indoor air quality systems include:</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Air Cleaners/Purifiers: </strong>Air cleaners, or purifiers, are installed into your HVAC system where they trap unwanted particles—such as dust, pet dander, bacteria, smoke, pollen, and other airborne contaminants—and remove them from circulating air. Modern air purifiers are highly effective at removing the majority of airborne pathogens from the air. </li>



<li><strong>UV Air Filters: </strong>UV air filters use ultraviolet light to kill bacteria, mold, and viruses, thereby effectively eliminating them from the home. Like air cleaners, UV air filters are typically installed right into your heating and cooling system. </li>



<li><strong>Humidifiers/Dehumidifiers: </strong>Single-room and whole-home humidifiers and dehumidifiers are excellent for balancing the humidity levels in your home. This can significantly decrease mold and mildew growth, as well as certain health conditions associated with excess or insufficient humidity, such as more frequent colds and cases of flu, skin irritation, and more.</li>



<li><strong>Carbon Monoxide Alarms: </strong>Carbon monoxide alarms are essential for your safety and the safety of your family. Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas that can cause dizziness, illness, and death. Today, most smoke detectors are also equipped with carbon monoxide alarms. </li>
</ul>



<p>Whether you wish to remove harmful particles from your home, or you want to improve your home’s humidity levels, the team at Medley Heating, Air Conditioning &amp; Plumbing is ready to help. We can recommend the right system for your needs and, once you’ve chosen the option you like best, install your new indoor air quality equipment.

<h1 class="wp-block-heading">UV Filtration &amp; Purification Installations In Carrolton, TX</h1>



<p>In theory, your home is your castle, the place where you’re safe from the many problems of the outside world. In practice, it doesn’t always work out that way. Even the air you breathe indoors can have a host of contaminants that can make you sick, or aggravate existing conditions like COPD, allergies, and asthma. For this reason, Medley Heating, Air Conditioning &amp; Plumbing offers&nbsp;<a href="https://www.callmedley.com/indoor-air-quality/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">indoor air quality solutions in the Dallas area</a>&nbsp;so you can breathe easier. Some of the most innovative are ultraviolet (UV) air filters for your HVAC system.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How UV HVAC Filters Work</h3>



<p>UV filtration and purification has been used for decades to render everything from surgical instruments to food and drinking water safe for use by and around humans. Like these tried-and-true methods, an HVAC air filter uses a shorter wavelength known as UV-C light that’s especially effective for decontamination. As the bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens pass through the light, the UV light kills them; some UV filters can also ionize air or water vapor (like indoor humidity), giving it a negative charge that boosts its antiviral and antibacterial properties.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Types of UV Air Filters</h3>



<p>UV filters can be free-standing, or they can be installed directly in your central air system. Each has its advantages. A free-standing system can be moved from room to room, while a UV air filter that’s integrated with your central air helps to purify the air in your entire home.</p>



<p>Furthermore, there are two subtypes of UV filters for HVAC units. There are coil sanitizing lights that help keep indoor condenser coils free of contaminants like mold and bacteria. There are also germicidal lights that can be installed in the ductwork or near the blower motor to purify the air itself.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Pros and Cons of UV Lights For HVAC</h3>



<p>When it comes to ensuring good indoor air quality, there’s no single magic bullet to solve all your problems. Simple things like dusting and keeping your windows closed matter, as do professionally-installed air quality solutions.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Benefits of UV Air Filters</h3>



<p>Indoor air contains a startling number of contaminants. UV light won’t address all of them; CFCs, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and other types of contamination require different types of filtration. However, when used in tandem with effective HVAC filters that are changed on schedule, a UV air filter is helpful.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Drawbacks of UV Air Filters</h3>



<p>Anything that kills pathogens depends on two key factors: the strength of the medium, and the time of exposure. On one hand, the UV lights used in an HVAC system aren’t too strong. On the other, unlike other applications that shine a UV light on something that’s immobile, like a hard surface or surgical instruments, a UV air filter is trying to sterilize something that has a high flow rate, so exposure time isn’t long at all.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Bottom Line: Is It Worth It?</h3>



<p>None of this is to say that there’s no place for UV air filtration. Since you asked, the bottom line is yes — if you’re willing to do it properly. A UV filter won’t be enough to ensure good indoor air quality on its own. But in conjunction with a good HEPA filter (which can trap up to 99% of particulate matter), a UV filter can be an added line of defense that leads to a healthier home.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Average Cost of UV HVAC Filters</h3>



<p>As a newer technology, the cost of UV HVAC filters is a bit higher than a standard air filter, or even HEPA filters or others with a higher MERV value. The initial cost will vary based on the type of filter and its installation. Operating costs are low, averaging $15 to $30 per year. There’s another cost involved, too. A UV light that’s burnt out, or covered with dust, won’t do much to the air one way or another, so there is maintenance and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.callmedley.com/indoor-air-quality/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">air duct cleaning</a>&nbsp;involved. But since you should be relying on Medley Heating, Air Conditioning &amp; Plumbing for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.callmedley.com/about-us/medley-family-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HVAC maintenance</a>&nbsp;on a regular basis anyway, this really doesn’t add much by way of cost.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Home Air Filtration in Carrollton, TX: Getting Started</h3>

<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Humidifier Installation in Carrolton, TX</h1>



<p>Are you considering a humidifier or a dehumidifier for your Dallas home? There are many reasons to install these units and we are always happy to answer your questions and help you get the unit that’s right for you. Our experts can help you explore all of your possibilities and give you the information you need to choose the option that works best for you and your family.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Humidifiers</h3>



<p>If you wake up with dry skin or a scratchy throat and you’re not sure why, chances are your home is too dry for you. This can happen even in Dallas, especially in the colder months. Different people have different humidity needs, and some find that they can only stay comfortable all year round if they have a whole-home humidifier they can turn on for part of the year.</p>



<p>Not sure if a humidifier is right for you? In addition to helping with dryness, humidifiers can aid in the following ways:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Reduce your energy or allergy symptoms. If you feel like you have a cold and you can’t get better or you have allergies year round, a humidifier might help you feel better. Adding moisture to the air you breathe is often good for your sinuses, nasal passages, throat, and more.</li>



<li>Improve your energy efficiency. When the air is more humid, it can be easier for your home to maintain its internal temperature. You may not have to run your heater or air conditioner as much to achieve the same levels of comfort, so you will save energy and do well by the planet.</li>



<li>Lower your energy costs. When you’re using less energy, you pay for less energy. A humidifier can help you lower your energy costs so you have more money to spend on the things you love.</li>
</ul>



<p>We can also help you with all of your humidifier repair and maintenance needs. We’ll help you replace filters, troubleshoot issues, and more. There’s no humidifier problem too big or too small for us to take on and handle for you.</p>



<p><a href="tel:4698874874"><strong>Give us a call at (469) 887-4874</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://www.callmedley.com/contact-us/"><strong>contact us online</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;today to request service.</strong></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Dehumidifiers</h3>



<p>Dallas can get hot and humid, especially in the summer. While it’s more comfortable than some places, there’s a lot more moisture in the air here than in some other locales. If the humidity is getting to you or you’re experiencing one of the problems listed below, a dehumidifier might be just what you need. Reasons to install a dehumidifier include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Mold or mildew growth in your home. If you notice mold or mildew growing in your home, or if you smell them, and you know your plumbing is working well, then you may need a dehumidifier. Mold and mildew grow where there’s moisture, so removing that can help hinder their growth.</li>



<li>Damaged wood furniture or floors. You may not notice extra moisture in your house but anything wood will. It absorbs the moisture and begins to crack, warp, and more. If you notice this type of damage, a dehumidifier could help you keep your nice things nice for a long time.</li>



<li>Condensation in your home. Do you notice condensation on your windows and you’re not sure how it got there? A dehumidifier will remove the extra moisture in the air that causes this. Not only will it clear up your windows, but it will also clear up condensation that you can’t see in places like your walls and floors, where it can cause even more damage.</li>
</ul>



<p>We can help you install, repair, and maintain your dehumidifier. Call us for your appointment today and remove all of the dangerous extra humidity from your home. We would love to help you live healthier today!</p>

<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Carrolton, TX Thermostat Installation</h1>



<p>Whether you’re having trouble with your thermostat or you’re thinking about installing a new one, call us at Medley Heating, Air Conditioning &amp; Plumbing to get all of your questions answered. We can help you figure out if you have a thermostat problem and decide whether to repair yours or replace it with a new version. We can talk with you through your thermostat options and help you choose the one that is best for you and your home.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Thermostat Repair</h3>



<p>A lot of homeowners don’t realize what’s wrong when they have a thermostat problem. They think that the issue is with their heating or air conditioning, or they just figure that their home doesn’t get any warmer or cooler than it currently is. Most of the time, though, you don’t have to sit around in a home that is uncomfortable. Call us and we will check your thermostat to see if it’s the source of the problem.</p>



<p>Common problems that indicate a thermostat malfunction include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Your heating or cooling seems to be stuck off…or on!</li>



<li>You have to keep changing the temperature on the thermostat to stay comfortable.</li>



<li>Your home isn’t the same temperature throughout.</li>



<li>Your heating or cooling systems are turning off and on rapidly.</li>
</ul>



<p>Call us as soon as you notice these problems and we’ll come fix your thermostat today!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Thermostat Replacement</h3>



<p>If your thermostat is old, you may want to consider upgrading to a newer version. Even if yours is still working, many homeowners find that new thermostats have technology that can save them money. Here are just a few of the features that many of our customers love!</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Programmable thermostats.</strong> These allow you to keep your home at particular temperatures at certain times of day. Have it turn on before you wake up, keep it off while everyone is at work, then turn it back on in the evening so the home is warm or cool when everyone gets home.</li>



<li><strong>Wireless thermostats.</strong> These allow you to control your thermostat via a smartphone app. You can also use the app to check in and see how your system is doing. If you need to change the temperature and you’re in the middle of a project far away from your thermostat, you still have the control that you need.</li>



<li><strong>Touchscreen thermostats.</strong> Change your temperature and adjust other settings via a touchscreen, rather than using buttons. These displays are usually larger and easier to read, too, for easier access.</li>
</ul>



<p>Of course, we would be happy to install any type of thermostat that you want.&nbsp;<a href="tel:4698874874">Just let us know</a>&nbsp;and we’ll get it in according to the manufacturer’s specifications.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Save Money On Your Energy Bills</h3>



<p>Installing programmable thermostats, whether they are wireless or have touchscreens or not, can save you money on your heating and air conditioning bills. You won’t have to run your heater all day just to come home to a warm house, so you’ll save the money you would have spent keeping it going all those hours that you were gone.</p>



<p>Having an app can save you even more. Instead of programming the thermostat, just change the temperature when you know you’re heading home. By the time you get there, it will be where you want it without spending any extra time at those higher or lower temperatures.</p>



<p>Some homeowners find that they recoup the costs that come with installing a programmable thermostat within months. They spend so much less on energy that they get their money back and more.</p>



<p>We would love to answer any of your questions about how one of these thermostats might help you save.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="tel:4698874874"><strong>Call (469) 887-4874</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://www.callmedley.com/contact-us/"><strong>contact us online</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;today to schedule your thermostat repair, today!</strong></p>

<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Carrolton, TX Attic Insulation</h1>



<p>Did you know that insulating your attic can save you money and keep you more comfortable all year round? That’s right! Attic insulation isn’t just right for people in cold climates. It can help you live better at home no matter where you live.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Save Money</strong></h3>



<p>Attic insulation helps you save money by saving energy. When your attic is insulated, less of the cold or hot air that you’re pumping into your house will escape. This means that your heating and air conditioning won’t have to work as hard. When they’re getting a break, you’re not using as much energy and, when you’re not using as much energy, your energy costs will go down.</p>



<p>You may also save money with attic insulation because you may not have to replace your heater and air conditioner as often. When they aren’t working as hard, they won’t sustain as much wear and tear. Since this eventually leads to damage, they may well last longer simply because you insulated your Carrollton attic.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Stay Comfortable</h3>



<p>Insulating your attic can help you stay more comfortable because it doesn’t let as much air escape. That extra layer can mean you stay cooler in the summer and warmer in the winter, all while using less energy. If you get cold at home or you feel like your comfort systems are always working overtime and barely hanging on, insulating your attic could be the solution you’ve been looking for.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Our Process</h3>



<p>Our Carrollton attic insulation team will come out and assess your current insulation situation. Insulation is rated based on an R-value. Different types of insulation have different R-values per inch. We know what your target R-value should be and we’ll be able to tell you whether or not you’re hitting it. These targets are based on optimizing your home for energy efficiency without overspending on insulation.</p>



<p>If you’re not hitting your target R-value, we’ll devise a solution to get you there. We may need to tear out your old insulation, or we might simply be able to add to it so you can retain hot and cold air better.</p>



<p>Once we have a plan, we’ll get to work and have your attic insulation done fast. We always wear appropriate protection while we work, and we’ll strive to protect you and your family, too. Some types of insulation can damage your lungs, but we won’t let that happen. When we’re done, your home’s indoor temperatures should be more stable and your utility bills should go down.</p>



<p>We’ll find a solution that works for you, then get it implemented quickly so you don’t waste your money anymore!</p>



<p><a href="tel:4698874874"><strong>Give us a call at (469) 887-4874</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://www.callmedley.com/contact-us/"><strong>contact us online</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;today to request service for attic insulation in Carrollton.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Indoor Air Quality Services in Carrollton, TX</h1>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Improving the Comfort, Health &amp; Safety of Your Home</h3>



<p>Most people don’t realize that the quality of the air inside their homes can be just as bad—if not worse—than the air quality outside. The good news is that there are many ways to improve your indoor air quality and enjoy a better, healthier home.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Importance of Indoor Air Quality Testing</h3>



<p>Over time, pollutants can collect in the air ducts and vents throughout your home. Contaminants like mold, mildew, bacteria, dust, and debris can be released into the air, leading to an array of health and safety concerns.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Poor indoor air quality has been associated with:</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Increased severity of asthma and allergy symptoms </li>



<li>Heightened risk of illness, including colds and respiratory problems</li>



<li>More frequent headaches, sore throat, and eye/nose irritation</li>



<li>Dizziness and nausea </li>
</ul>



<p>With prolonged exposure to poor indoor air quality, people are at risk of even more serious health conditions, such as respiratory illness, cardiovascular disease, developmental delays, and even cancer. Certain individuals—such as children, pregnant women, and the elderly—face an increased risk of serious health problems related to poor indoor air quality.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Indoor air quality tests are simple, effective, and non-invasive. At&nbsp;<a href="https://www.callmedley.com/">Medley Heating, Air Conditioning &amp; Plumbing</a>, we can quickly and easily assess your indoor air quality and tell you whether you should consider products or services to enhance the safety of your home. We can also help you create a customized indoor air quality plan to meet your specific needs, as well as the needs of your family.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How to Improve Your Indoor Air Quality</h3>



<p><strong>There are several ways to improve the quality of the air inside your home:&nbsp;</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Duct Cleaning: </strong>Regular <a href="https://www.callmedley.com/indoor-air-quality/">air duct cleaning</a> can significantly improve your indoor air quality. During our routine duct cleaning service, we thoroughly remove all dust, debris, pet dander, and other particles from inside the ducts, thereby preventing them from being spread around your home and into the air you and your family breathe. </li>



<li><strong>Installing Indoor Air Quality Equipment:</strong> There are various products to choose from when it comes to improving your home’s indoor air quality. At Medley Heating, Air Conditioning &amp; Plumbing, we offer top-quality systems from industry-leading brands, including <a href="https://www.callmedley.com/indoor-air-quality/uv-filtration-purification/">UV filtration and purification systems</a>, air purifiers, carbon monoxide detectors, and more. </li>



<li><strong>Installing a Whole-Home Humidifier/Dehumidifier: </strong>Humidity plays a large role in overall indoor air quality. Excess humidity can foster mold and mildew growth, whereas lack of humidity can lead to eye, nose, throat, and skin irritation, among other issues. A <a href="https://www.callmedley.com/indoor-air-quality/humidifiers-dehumidifiers/">whole-home humidifier/dehumidifier</a> can help combat this problem. </li>



<li><strong>Choose a Smart Thermostat: </strong>New “smart” <a href="https://www.callmedley.com/indoor-air-quality/thermostats/">thermostats</a> can not only help maintain optimal temperature levels throughout your home; they can also monitor indoor air quality and alert you when the air quality drops. We can help you find a thermostat that meets your needs. </li>

<p>We want to help you find the&nbsp;<em>right&nbsp;</em>solution for your home. Get in touch with our team at Medley Heating, Air Conditioning &amp; Plumbing today to learn more about our indoor air quality services in Carrollton and how we can help you with your air quality concerns.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Choose the Indoor Air Quality Experts at Medley</h3>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Types of Indoor Air Quality Systems</strong></h3>



<p>When it comes to selecting an indoor air quality system, you have several options to choose from. Different types of systems offer different results; finding the right equipment for your home depends on your unique health and comfort concerns.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Some of the different types of indoor air quality systems include:</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Air Cleaners/Purifiers: </strong>Air cleaners, or purifiers, are installed into your HVAC system where they trap unwanted particles—such as dust, pet dander, bacteria, smoke, pollen, and other airborne contaminants—and remove them from circulating air. Modern air purifiers are highly effective at removing the majority of airborne pathogens from the air. </li>



<li><strong>UV Air Filters: </strong>UV air filters use ultraviolet light to kill bacteria, mold, and viruses, thereby effectively eliminating them from the home. Like air cleaners, UV air filters are typically installed right into your heating and cooling system. </li>



<li><strong>Humidifiers/Dehumidifiers: </strong>Single-room and whole-home humidifiers and dehumidifiers are excellent for balancing the humidity levels in your home. This can significantly decrease mold and mildew growth, as well as certain health conditions associated with excess or insufficient humidity, such as more frequent colds and cases of flu, skin irritation, and more.</li>



<li><strong>Carbon Monoxide Alarms: </strong>Carbon monoxide alarms are essential for your safety and the safety of your family. Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas that can cause dizziness, illness, and death. Today, most smoke detectors are also equipped with carbon monoxide alarms. </li>
</ul>



<p>Whether you wish to remove harmful particles from your home, or you want to improve your home’s humidity levels, the team at Medley Heating, Air Conditioning &amp; Plumbing is ready to help. We can recommend the right system for your needs and, once you’ve chosen the option you like best, install your new indoor air quality equipment.
