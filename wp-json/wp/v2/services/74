Different types of systems offer different results; finding the right equipment for your home depends on your unique health and comfort concerns.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Some of the different types of indoor air quality systems include:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Air Cleaners\/Purifiers:\u00a0<\/strong>Air cleaners, or purifiers, are installed into your HVAC system where they trap unwanted particles\u2014such as dust, pet dander, bacteria, smoke, pollen, and other airborne contaminants\u2014and remove them from circulating air. Modern air purifiers are highly effective at removing the majority of airborne pathogens from the air.\u00a0<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>UV Air Filters:\u00a0<\/strong>UV air filters use ultraviolet light to kill bacteria, mold, and viruses, thereby effectively eliminating them from the home. Like air cleaners, UV air filters are typically installed right into your heating and cooling system.\u00a0<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Humidifiers\/Dehumidifiers:\u00a0<\/strong>Single-room and whole-home humidifiers and dehumidifiers are excellent for balancing the humidity levels in your home. This can significantly decrease mold and mildew growth, as well as certain health conditions associated with excess or insufficient humidity, such as more frequent colds and cases of flu, skin irritation, and more.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Carbon Monoxide Alarms:\u00a0<\/strong>Carbon monoxide alarms are essential for your safety and the safety of your family. Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas that can cause dizziness, illness, and death. Today, most smoke detectors are also equipped with carbon monoxide alarms.\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you wish to remove harmful particles from your home, or you want to improve your home\u2019s humidity levels, the team at Medley Heating, Air Conditioning &amp; Plumbing is ready to help.
