Leaks can appear anywhere in your plumbing system, whether from your plumbing pipes hidden in your walls or those buried beneath your home. Medley specializes in detecting various residential leaks to help keep your home safe and your plumbing system running smoothly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether a visible or hidden leak, we offer detection for numerous types of leaks. These include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Pipe leaks\u00a0<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Slab leaks<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ceiling leaks<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Wall leaks<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Toilet leaks<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ceiling leaks<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Faucet leaks<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Underground leaks<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Leak Detection Process<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Medley plumbing team aims for efficient and precise leak detection to minimize disruption to your home. Your plumber starts by learning more about your concerns, such as water stains or other warning signs, and carefully inspects your plumbing system to identify the leak and its underlying cause. If your leak is hidden, they\u2019ll likely employ non-invasive technology to find water leaks obscured behind your walls, beneath your floors, or elsewhere.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once we\u2019ve located the source of the leak, we\u2019ll provide you with a detailed report and estimate of the necessary repair. Most water leak detections only take a few hours depending on where they\u2019re located, and repairs vary based on the nature of the problem.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Leak detection methods<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Advanced plumbing tools allow our team to locate the exact location of leaks without causing unnecessary damage to your home. Here are common leak detection methods:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Acoustic leak detection:\u00a0<\/strong>Acoustic methods use specialized sensors to listen for sounds associated with leaks.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Thermal imaging cameras:\u00a0<\/strong>Thermal cameras scan obscuring structures in your home for temperature patterns indicating moisture, with colder areas indicating potential leaks.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Video pipe inspection:\u00a0<\/strong>High-resolution cameras attached to a flexible cable feed into your pipes and transit live footage to the plumber.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Pressure testing:\u00a0<\/strong>These tests involve filling your system with pressurized air or water. Pressure drops usually confirm a leak.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Ground penetrating radar:\u00a0<\/strong>This technology sends radar waves into the ground to highlight abnormal signs associated with leaks.\u00a0<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Ultrasonic leak detection:\u00a0<\/strong>Sound waves pick up high-frequency sounds created by escaping water. Plumbers analyze the sounds to determine the leak location.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>When you need leak detection services<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Our leak detection services help you identify factors contributing to plumbing problems, and recognizing these factors can help you take preventative measures against undetected water leaks in your home. Regular maintenance and professional inspection of your plumbing system can help nip potential issues in the bud before they escalate into more severe problems.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Common water leak causes include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Corrosion:\u00a0<\/strong>Hard water, high flow velocity, bacteria, and other factors contribute to\u00a0pipe corrosion over time, resulting in small leaks that might go unnoticed until substantial damage occurs.\u00a0<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>High water pressure:<\/strong>\u00a0Excessive pressure can cause pipes to crack or burst.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Temperature changes:<\/strong>\u00a0Temperature fluctuations make pipes expand and contract, causing cracks and subsequent leaks over time.\u00a0<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Tree roots:<\/strong>\u00a0Roots can infiltrate and crack your pipes, especially in older homes with porous clay pipes more prone to root intrusion.\u00a0<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Poor installation:<\/strong>\u00a0Improperly installed pipes\u00a0or fixtures\u00a0can leak at the joints where they connect to other pipes, a common issue in older homes with\u00a0outdated\u00a0plumbing standards.\u00a0<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Old age:<\/strong>\u00a0Even highly durable pipe materials wear out over time and may develop leaks.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Clogged drains:<\/strong>\u00a0A blocked drain may result in high pipe pressure and lead to leaks.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Benefits of Professional Leak Detection<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Left unaddressed, leaks can lead to significant, irreversible, and costly damage to your home\u2019s key structures. Many obscured leaks damage your home before you notice signs, so hiring a professional enables early detection and therefore minimizes impact.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since leaks can waste&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.epa.gov\/watersense\/fix-leak-week\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">10,000 gallons of water<\/a>&nbsp;per home each year, early leak detection and repair also saves on water bill costs. In addition to providing precise results, minimally invasive detection strategies also prevent unnecessary excavation or demolition and associated repair costs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Signs You May Have a Leak<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Swift response is the best way to minimize leak impacts. Call Medley for assistance if you notice these signs:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Drips or standing water<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>High water bills<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Visible mold or musty odors<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Cracks in walls, floors, and ceilings<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Water stains on ceilings and walls<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Low water pressure<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Warped floors and baseboards<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Termite or pest activity<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Flaking indoor or exterior paint or bubbling wallpaper<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Find and Fix Leaks With Medley in Carrollton, Texas<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When you choose Medley, you can keep your home leak-free and enjoy a reliable plumbing system.
