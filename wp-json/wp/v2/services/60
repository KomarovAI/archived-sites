Save yourself the hassle&nbsp;and act at the first sign of trouble.&nbsp;Some key indicators that&nbsp;it\u2019s time to consider replacing your furnace include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Your furnace is old:\u00a0<\/strong>Most furnaces last between 10 and 20 years. If your furnace is nearing\u00a0the end of its lifespan,\u00a0consider replacing it to ensure you and your family stay warm\u00a0through the chilly Texas winters.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Your furnace doesn\u2019t heat as well as it used to:\u00a0<\/strong>As your furnace ages, wear and tear results in reduced efficiency and airflow.\u00a0If it no longer\u00a0keeps up with your household\u2019s demands, it may be time for a\u00a0home heating upgrade.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>You have health concerns<\/strong>: An\u00a0aging\u00a0furnace allows more dust, debris, and allergens into your home, creating poor\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.callmedley.com\/indoor-air-quality\/\">indoor air quality<\/a>.\u00a0It\u00a0can also permit poisonous gasses, such as\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.cpsc.gov\/Safety-Education\/Safety-Education-Centers\/Carbon-Monoxide-Information-Center#:~:text=Know%20the%20symptoms%20of%20carbon,immediately%2C%20and%20then%20call%20911.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">carbon monoxide<\/a>, to\u00a0enter the air if it malfunctions. If anyone in your\u00a0household\u00a0has health concerns and believes your furnace could be worsening symptoms, call us to\u00a0discuss\u00a0new furnace installation.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Your furnace makes unusual noises:<\/strong>\u00a0If you\u00a0hear banging, popping, or other unusual noises, this\u00a0can indicate that something has broken\u00a0within\u00a0your heating system.\u00a0While\u00a0repair may solve some issues, others require\u00a0complete\u00a0replacement. Our technicians will inspect your furnace and determine whether you need repairs or new installation.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Your energy bills are rising:\u00a0<\/strong>Over time, wear and tear causes your furnace to work harder to produce the same amount of heat. If you notice an unexpected spike in your utility bills, installing a new, high-efficiency furnace will help keep your energy usage down.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Choosing the Right Furnace for Your Home<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two main types of residential furnaces: gas and electric. The&nbsp;right&nbsp;furnace for your home depends on your comfort preferences, budget, and house size. In general, gas furnaces are more energy efficient than electric furnaces. They also heat homes more quickly and are cheaper to install. However, the upfront price of a new gas furnace is more than that of a new electric model, and&nbsp;they&nbsp;do pose some safety concerns. Electric furnaces tend to last longer than gas furnaces, meaning you could save money on HVAC replacement costs in the long run.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our&nbsp;team at Medley Heating, Air Conditioning, and Plumbing will help you determine which type of furnace&nbsp;best suits&nbsp;your needs.&nbsp;We\u2019re&nbsp;happy to answer any questions you may have and provide our personalized, professional recommendations.
