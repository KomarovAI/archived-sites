With attention to the indoor unit, drainage system care, and condenser unit restoration, our services at Medley go deeper than routine maintenance to revitalize and overhaul your HVAC system.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is System Restoration?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Designed to rejuvenate your HVAC, system restoration addresses a range of components to improve AC efficiency and longevity. It goes beyond the usual checks and adjustments of a standard AC tune-up, instead aiming to rectify underlying problems contributing to performance decline or breakdowns.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Benefits of HVAC system restoration<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Regular wear, environmental conditions, and outdated technology gradually decrease HVAC efficiency. HVAC restoration, however, offers numerous benefits to help you get more from your system, such as lower energy bills, reduced wear, and an extended lifespan.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Condenser Unit Restoration: Keeping Your Cool<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As the outdoor part of your&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.callmedley.com\/air-conditioning\/\">AC system<\/a>, the condenser is prone to dirt and debris accumulation that may lead to reduced performance or breakdowns. In some cases, a replacement is necessary when the cost of a failed compressor outweighs the cost of a new unit, though you can avoid a costly replacement by restoring or upgrading condenser components.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A failing motor causes overheating, reduced efficiency, and even complete system failure. If it has mechanical issues or fails altogether, replacing the condenser fan motor&nbsp;can make a big impact on your AC\u2019s performance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other condenser restoration tasks may include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Capacitor replacement:\u00a0<\/strong>Capacitors store and release energy to kickstart the compressor and fan motor \u2014 when it fails, your system can\u2019t start. Replacing a faulty capacitor is a relatively minor fix that can make a big difference between a functional or failing system.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Compressor contactor replacement:\u00a0<\/strong>Compressor contactors regulate the flow of electricity. Replacing a faulty contactor helps minimize the risk of surges or fluctuations that may damage your system and lead to more costly repairs.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Compressor start assist:\u00a0<\/strong>An optional add-on to your system, a start assist provides extra power to your compressor when it kicks on, helping it get up to speed faster and easing strain on components.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Deep cleaning:\u00a0<\/strong>Professional deep cleaning removes dust and debris that may hinder your system\u2019s efficiency from the condenser coil and other areas.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Drainage System Care: Preventing Water Damage<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>HVACs have drainage systems that remove water extracted from the air and direct it outside. Without maintenance, drainage systems may cause water damage, high indoor humidity, frozen evaporator coils, mold, and other signs suggesting increased strain and wear on your system.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Preventing water damage involves either cleaning or replacing the condensate drain pan, AC drain line cleaning, drain modification, or installing flood protection. If your technician finds buildup and clogs in your drainage system, they can deep clean the pan and drain line, remediating rust from the pan and unclogging the line if necessary.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Indoor Unit Attention: Optimizing Airflow and Comfort<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>AC revitalization services rejuvenate indoor unit components to optimize airflow, improve efficiency, and reduce AC noise.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">AC air filter<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The AC air filter is an essential part that maintains indoor air quality by removing most debris and other particles before entering the indoor unit. Filters require replacement every 1 to 3 months depending on usage. The right air filter should be compatible with your specific AC model.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Leaks<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Cracks, leaks, corrosion, and defects in your system can cause numerous problems for your AC that reduce its efficiency and lifespan. For instance, leaks may cause uneven or insufficient cooling and heating throughout your home and&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.energystar.gov\/saveathome\/heating-cooling\/duct-sealing\/benefits\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">lower efficiency by 20% or more<\/a>. Our technicians can use lifetime sealant, a specialized adhesive, to seal joints and connections in your HVAC system.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Blower motor replacement<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The blower motor circulates air throughout your home \u2014 without a functioning blower, your system can\u2019t properly heat or cool your home or&nbsp;improve air quality. Deep cleaning is often the first step if your blower motor isn\u2019t working as it should, but a failed motor typically needs replacement altogether.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Evaporator coil cleaning<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Dirt, corrosion, and debris buildup on the evaporator coil impede the heat exchange process and can lead to freezing, leaks, excessive condensation, and other problems. Using a specialized process, your technician can carefully deep clean your evaporator coil to restore it to proper efficiency.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Furnace maintenance<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Restoring a&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.callmedley.com\/heating\/\">furnace<\/a>&nbsp;helps ensure its performance, safety, and longevity. Restoration services may include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Gas valve replacement<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ignitor replacement<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Flame sensor cleaning<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Understanding the Warranty and Exclusions<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>HVAC equipment generally comes with a manufacturer warranty, which generally covers faulty components, compressor failure, and other problems related to defects in materials. If your HVAC equipment is still under warranty, your policy may cover the replacement of certain parts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Owner neglect, improper maintenance, modifications, and others may violate the warranty as per its requirements, leaving you responsible for repair and replacement costs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if you\u2019re no longer covered by warranty, restoration services help return your system to proper function by addressing worn parts, poor installation, and other problems, saving you the cost of a full system replacement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Is AC System Restoration Right for Me?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Routine tune-ups keep your system running smoothly ahead of each cooling season, but they\u2019re not always adequate for major wear or other concerns. If your HVAC frequently breaks down, is inefficient, or otherwise isn\u2019t working as it should, a system restoration helps reset it. Restoration minimizes the strain that worn or damaged components may cause to each other, potentially saving on repair and premature replacement costs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why Choose Medley for System Restoration?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Choosing Medley for HVAC system restoration comes with numerous advantages to ensure the reliability of your HVAC system and your customer satisfaction.&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.callmedley.com\/service-area\/\">Serving Carrollton<\/a>, Addison, Lewisville, and other Texas areas, we\u2019re known for:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Prompt and on-time service<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/pricing.callmedley.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Transparent pricing<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>5-star customer service<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Expert workmanship<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.callmedley.com\/financing\/\">Flexible financing<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Restore Your HVAC and Call Medley in Carrollton, Texas<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>From air handler repair to condenser fan replacement, our restoration services overhaul your system and improve your home\u2019s comfort.&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.callmedley.com\/contact-us\/#book\">Contact us<\/a>&nbsp;or book online to learn more and schedule a restoration.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Frequently Asked Questions<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What are the signs that my AC needs restoration?<\/strong><\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Signs that your AC needs restoration include high energy bills, uneven or insufficient cooling, strange noises, and persistent breakdowns.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How should I maintain my AC between professional tune-ups and restoration?<\/strong><\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to scheduling annual professional maintenance, homeowners should routinely replace air filters, clear the outdoor unit of debris, and keep ductwork vents open and unobstructed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What doesn\u2019t restoration include?<\/strong><\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Our restoration services do not include replacement of these parts and components:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Thermostat<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Control board<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Heat strips<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Compressor<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Evaporator coil<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Condenser coil<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Refrigerant lines<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Plenums<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ductwork<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>System Restoration: Breathe New Life into Your HVAC in Carrollton System restoration is like a hard reset for your HVAC.
