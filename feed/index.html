										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>Key Takeaways</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your air conditioner controls humidity levels by removing moisture from the air, condensing it into water droplets, and draining it through the condensate line.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several issues, such as a clogged line, low refrigerant levels, or leaking ductwork, can prevent your AC from dehumidifying indoor air.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clammy or sticky air, peeling paint, and visible mold are some of the most common signs of excessively high humidity levels.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Medley offers expert AC repairs and maintenance services that help control humidity levels and restore your home to a comfortable environment.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Why Indoor Humidity Matters</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Controlling the humidity levels inside your home is more than just a matter of comfort. High humidity levels create an ideal environment for mold and mildew growth, triggering allergy symptoms, worsening asthma, and damaging your property. Over time, it can also cause wood to crack, shrink, or warp, damaging furniture, instruments, and other belongings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing the signs, potential causes, and steps to take when your AC is causing humidity problems helps you catch the issue early on to prevent health issues and structural damage.</span></p>
<h2><strong>How Does an AC Control Humidity?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Air conditioners are a helpful tool in controlling humidity levels within your home. Throughout the cooling process, they remove moisture from the air to maintain balanced levels.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">The role of your AC in moisture removal</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several AC components contribute to the moisture removal process. When warm air passes over the evaporator coils, the coils cool the air, causing the moisture in it to condense into water droplets. These droplets then collect on the coils, where they’re drained away through the condensate line. After removing the moisture, your AC circulates cool, dehumidified air back into your home.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Common AC humidity problems</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When something goes wrong with your air conditioner, it can prevent the system from dehumidifying the air. The most common</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">air conditioner humidity issues include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dirty evaporator coils</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clogged drain lines</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Low refrigerant levels</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Incorrect thermostat settings</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">An oversized system</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leaking ductwork</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Poor ventilation</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lack of maintenance</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Why Is My House in Carrollton, TX, Still Humid with the AC On?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your Carrollton home is feeling hot and sticky, there are a few culprits that could be the cause. Failing components, poor maintenance, or improper installation can all keep your air conditioner from effectively removing moisture from the air.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Signs your AC isn’t removing humidity</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recognizing the signs that your AC is struggling to maintain humidity levels allows you to catch the issue early, preventing it from escalating into costly repairs. If you notice any of the following, schedule an AC inspection with Medley to restore your home comfort:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Clammy or sticky air: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Damp or heavy-feeling air inside your home is one of the top signs that your air conditioner is allowing humidity levels to rise.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Musty smells: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you notice a musty odor around your home, it may be due to excess moisture that’s allowing mold and mildew to grow.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Condensation: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visible condensation on your windows, walls, or other surfaces is a clear indication that your AC is not effectively pulling moisture from the air.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Inconsistent temperatures: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your AC is struggling to dehumidify the air, some rooms may feel warmer than others due to the excess moisture in the air.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Wall damage: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Peeling paint or bubbling wallpaper is often caused by high humidity levels that trap moisture behind surfaces.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>DIY Tips To Reduce Indoor Humidity</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a few easy ways you can keep indoor humidity levels balanced. Optimizing your air conditioner, installing additional systems, and promptly </span><a href="https://www.callmedley.com/air-conditioning/ac-repair/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">addressing AC repairs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> help reduce moisture levels, keeping your home cool and comfortable throughout the hot summer months.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">What homeowners can check</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best way to </span><a href="https://www.epa.gov/mold/what-are-main-ways-control-moisture-your-home" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">control humidity levels</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is to check that your air conditioner is set to the proper settings and functioning correctly. Here are a few tips to help your AC perform at its best:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Set your system to “dry mode” or “economy mode,” which are specifically designed to dehumidify the air.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Set the thermostat to “auto” instead of “on” to prevent the fan from recirculating moisture.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.callmedley.com/air-conditioning/ac-maintenance/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schedule AC maintenance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for humidity issues at least once a year to keep all components functioning properly.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Turn your AC fan speed to a lower setting to help improve humidity removal.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with optimizing your air conditioner, there are some other strategies you can use to keep humidity levels down, including:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Installing a dehumidifier in areas with excessive humidity.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Turning on exhaust fans in your bathrooms and kitchens after cooking or showering.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Checking for proper ventilation throughout your home.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Addressing leaks as soon as possible to prevent moisture from spreading.</span></li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>Key Takeaways</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The differences between gas and electric water heaters affect cost, efficiency, installation, and performance.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gas heaters generally recover hot water faster, while electric models are easier to install and maintain.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your household size, utility connections, and other factors determine the best type of water heater for your home.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Trying to Decide Between Gas and Electric? Here’s What You Need to Know</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re unsure whether to choose a gas vs. electric water heater, consider how your household size, water usage, and other factors may affect performance and long-term costs. Both types deliver hot water for everyday use, but they work differently and offer different benefits. Medley’s licensed technicians are available to guide you through each option.</span></p>
<h2><strong>What’s the Difference Between a Gas and Electric Water Heater?</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.callmedley.com/plumbing/water-heater-services/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gas and electric water heaters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> warm water for showers, laundry, and dishes, but they differ in operation. Their designs, installation requirements, efficiency levels, and other characteristics vary in ways that affect energy bills, convenience, and safety.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Gas water heaters:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> These units heat water with a burner at the bottom of the tank, fueled by natural gas or propane. They require venting to release combustion gases and a gas line connection for fuel.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Electric water heaters:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> These systems use electric resistance coils to heat water. They’re easier to install since they don’t involve combustion or venting and only need a dedicated 240-volt electrical circuit.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Pros and Cons of Gas vs. Electric Water Heaters</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both types of water heaters offer advantages depending on your goals and your home’s infrastructure. Consider performance, efficiency, and ownership costs to weigh the pros and cons of gas and electric water heaters.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upfront cost</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Electric water heaters tend to cost less upfront since installation is simpler compared to gas units. Gas water heaters usually have higher initial installation costs to account for the added complexity of adding exhaust systems and gas line connections.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Energy efficiency and long-term operating costs</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since they convert almost all electrical energy into heat, electric models are generally more </span><a href="https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/selecting-new-water-heater" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">energy efficient</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> than gas water heaters. However, electricity rates may be more expensive in certain areas, which can result in higher bills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gas heaters have slightly lower efficiency ratings due to heat loss through venting. Even so, gas is often more affordable than electricity, which may save more on utility bills over the heater&#8217;s lifespan, particularly if your household has high hot water demand.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speed &amp; hot water recovery time</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gas water heaters typically heat water more quickly than electric units, and this recovery time makes a difference for busy households with heavy usage habits. Electric heaters recover hot water more slowly, which may cause delays during peak usage.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Safety, installation, and maintenance</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Electric water heaters don’t use ventilation or combustion, so they don’t carry risks of carbon monoxide or natural gas leaks. Maintenance is also simpler since electric units have fewer and less complex components than gas models.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gas heaters have more complex installation and safety requirements. Maintenance includes periodic burner, flue, and ignition system inspections to minimize the risk of gas-related hazards.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lifespan &amp; reliability</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gas and electric water heaters last about 10 years, though electric units can maintain reliable and efficient operation for up to 15 years. Electric models are more resistant to internal corrosion because they operate at lower temperatures and don’t involve combustion.</span></p>
<h2><strong>How Do I Know Which Water Heater Is Right for My Home?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deciding which is better between gas or electric water heaters depends on your home’s utility connections and your household’s needs. Here are a few questions to help guide your decision.</span><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Do you have access to natural gas or propane? </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your home already has a gas line, a gas water heater may be more economical — otherwise, electric models are often the simplest and most affordable option.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Is your household small, average, or large?</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Large households may prefer the recovery speed of a gas unit.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Do you want the lowest upfront cost or long-term savings? </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Electric units are generally less expensive to install, but gas models may offer better long-term value.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Is safety or installation speed more important to you?</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Electric heaters are easier to install and don’t carry the risk of gas or carbon monoxide leaks. Gas heaters are safe with proper installation, but require more planning and labor.</span></li>

<h2><strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong></h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do gas water heaters work during power outages?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some gas water heaters can operate during power outages, especially models with a pilot light ignition instead of electronic controls. However, many newer units use electric ignition or safety systems, which means they won&#8217;t function without electricity. Electric water heaters don’t work during outages.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">What size water heater do I need for my household?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The right </span><a href="https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/sizing-new-water-heater" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">water heater size</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> depends on your household&#8217;s daily hot water usage. A family of four may need an 80-gallon tank, while a 50- to 60-gallon tank is often enough for smaller households.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Can I install a water heater myself?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some areas allow homeowners to install their own water heaters, but this requires plumbing, electrical, and natural gas expertise. Improper installation can cause safety risks and damage to equipment.</span></p>

<h2><strong>Mini-Split vs. Central Air: Which One Is Right for You?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When your cooling system is due for an upgrade, it can be challenging to determine whether a mini-split or central air system is better for your home. Central air conditioners offer convenient whole-home cooling but require a duct system to keep cool air flowing throughout your space. On the other hand, mini-splits offer energy-efficient, customizable cooling at a higher upfront cost. In this guide, we’ll explore the pros and cons of </span><a href="https://www.callmedley.com/blog/2023/august/ductless-mini-split-systems-the-future-of-air-co/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ductless mini splits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> vs. central AC systems to help you make the right choice for your home.</span></p>
<h2><strong>What’s the Difference Between a Mini-Split and Central Air?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While mini-splits and central air systems both help keep homes cool, they differ in how they distribute cool air throughout the space. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Central air conditioning:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Uses an indoor air handler and an outdoor condenser. It draws warm air in via ductwork, cools it with refrigerant, and recirculates it with ducts and fans.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Ductless mini-splits:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> No ductwork needed. Each zone has an indoor unit that cools and recirculates air directly into the space.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>What Are the Pros and Cons of Mini-Splits vs. Central Air?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Central air conditioners and ductless ACs offer unique benefits and drawbacks, making them better suited for unique situations. Understanding the </span><a href="https://www.callmedley.com/blog/2024/january/pros-cons-of-different-hvac-systems/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pros and cons of each system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> helps you make the right choice for your home. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Energy efficiency comparison</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When cooled air travels through your ductwork, it can escape through leaks and cracks, preventing it from reaching your living spaces and forcing your central air system to use more energy. Mini-splits avoid </span><a href="https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/minimizing-energy-losses-ducts" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this energy loss</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by eliminating the need for ductwork and delivering cool air directly into your space.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Installation considerations</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mini-splits offer more </span><a href="https://www.callmedley.com/air-conditioning/ac-installation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">convenient installation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in homes without existing ductwork, as they don’t require extensive construction or air duct installation. Central air systems, on the other hand, can be more complex and time-consuming to install but offer convenient whole-home cooling for spaces with an existing duct system.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Comfort &amp; control</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mini-splits allow you to control each indoor unit individually, allowing you to customize temperatures in certain areas of your home. Central air conditioners provide consistent, whole-home cooling, eliminating hot spots and temperature variations between rooms. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aesthetics and noise</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Central air conditioners are often concealed in attics, basements, or utility closets, keeping the equipment out of sight and reducing noise levels in your space. Mini-splits are mounted on the walls, making them more visible and potentially distracting.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Common Scenarios: Which System Works Best Where?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The right cooling system for your space depends on your layout, cooling needs, and budget. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mini-splits work best for:</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Garages, add-ons, and sunrooms</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Older homes without ductwork</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Individual rooms or multi-zone control</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Energy-conscious households</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Central air works best for:</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Newer or existing ducted homes</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Larger homes needing even cooling</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Families wanting a hidden system</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Homeowners planning whole-home HVAC upgrades</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>How Do I Know Which System Is Right for My Space?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before choosing a cooling system, ask yourself the following questions: </span><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>How large is the space you&#8217;re trying to cool? </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Central ACs are best for large homes that require even cooling, while mini-splits are ideal for small areas or individual rooms.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Do you already have ductwork installed? </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Homes without existing ductwork often benefit from the straightforward, duct-free installation of a mini-split.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Are energy savings or upfront costs more important? </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">While central air systems may have lower </span><a href="https://www.callmedley.com/clear-cost-pricing/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">upfront costs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, mini-splits offer long-term energy savings for years to come.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Do you need both heating and cooling? </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike central air systems that only produce cool air, mini-splits offer two-in-one heating and cooling capabilities.</span></li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A clogged condensate drain line may not be the first AC issue to come to mind if you’re having problems with your system. However, this is a common cause for AC shutdowns and other issues, which is why it’s vital that homeowners learn about this component. Keep reading to learn about the signs that your AC drain line is clogged, the potential effects of this issue, and how an HVAC professional can help.</p>
<h2>AC Suddenly Stops Working? A Clogged Drain Line Could Be the Culprit</h2>
<p>Nothing is quite as frustrating as an air conditioner that won’t turn on when you need it. As your local <a href="https://www.callmedley.com/carrollton/air-conditioning/repair/">AC repair pros</a>, condensate drain line repair is one of the most common jobs we’re hired to do. A simple fix to this component could be what you need to get your air conditioner up and running again.</p>
<h2>What Is a Condensate Drain Line—and Why Does It Matter?</h2>
<p>Your condensate drain line is responsible for redirecting the condensed moisture that is accumulated during the air cooling process. This helps to prevent water from building up in the system and overflowing, helping you avoid water damage to your home and to the components of your air conditioner.</p>
<p>Issues with the drain line can easily shut down your air conditioner. A safety feature called a float switch will engage if too much water enters the system, triggering a system shutdown to prevent electrical hazards and water damage. To get the system running again, you’ll need to address the air conditioner water leak at the source, which typically means fixing the drain line.</p>
<h2>Signs Your Condensate Drain Line Is Clogged</h2>
<p>Let’s look at the top clogged AC drain symptoms for homeowners to lookout for:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Water pooling around the indoor unit.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">AC turning on and off frequently (short-cycling).</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Moldy or musty odors near vents.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Wet air filter or drain pan overflow.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">AC stops running with no obvious reason,</li>
</ul>
<p>These signs can indicate an issue with the drain line or pan, but the only way to know for sure is to consult a professional HVAC technician.</p>
<p>A technician will confirm this <a href="https://www.callmedley.com/blog/2023/june/ac-repair-101-common-issues-andtroubleshooting-t/">common AC problem</a> in a few ways, such as with a visual inspection, testing of the float switch, and line flushing. Using these methods, they’ll determine if the drain line is the source of the issue, which will help them determine the next steps to get the system running again.</p>
<h2>Can You Unclog the Drain Line Yourself?</h2>
<p>If your AC keeps shutting off and you suspect the drain line is to blame, there are a few ways you can try to fix the issue yourself.</p>
<h3>Simple DIY methods</h3>
<p>AC not draining water? Try fixing the issue yourself with these easy DIY methods:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Flush the drain line using vinegar and/or hot water.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Use a wet/dry vacuum from the outdoor line to remove the clog.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">If accessible, clear the line from the access point using a drain snake.</li>
</ul>
<h3>When to call a professional</h3>
<p>If your <a href="https://www.callmedley.com/blog/2021/june/why-is-my-air-conditioner-not-working-/">AC is not working</a> and you can’t seem to fix it yourself, it’s time to call a professional. The same goes for drain lines with multiple clogs, as it can be very difficult to remove them all yourself. If there is any possibility of electrical risk or water damage, or if your float switch continuously triggers after being reset, we strongly recommend contacting a professional. Attempting to fix this issue yourself can <a href="https://www.rsi.edu/blog/hvacr/hvac-hacks-educating-customers-about-the-risks-of-diy-hvac/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lead to serious injury</a> from electric shock or extensive water damage to your home.</p>
<h2>Risks of Ignoring a Clogged Drain Line</h2>
<p>There are several risks of inaction if you notice a drain line issue during your <a href="https://www.callmedley.com/blog/2023/march/it-s-time-for-spring-cleaning/">springtime AC maintenance</a>. Pooling and leaking water can lead to water damage to surrounding floors and drywall, which can potentially lead to mold growth in and around your HVAC system. This can also put excess strain on AC components, causing damage to the blower motor or circuit board and increasing future repair costs.</p>
<p>No one likes being forced to pay for AC repairs. But by addressing drain line issues now, you’ll be paying a small amount compared to the costs of replacing the unit and getting water remediation after HVAC failure.</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3>Why is water leaking from my AC?</h3>
<p>The most common cause of leaking water is an issue with the condensate drain pan or drain line. Other potential causes include frozen evaporator coils, low refrigerant levels, and dirty air filters.</p>
<h3>How do I know if my AC drain line is clogged?</h3>
<p>The most common signs of a clogged AC drain line are leaking and pooling water around the unit, the AC turning off and on constantly (short-cycling), and moldy, musty odors in HVAC vents.</p>
<h3>Why is my AC not turning on, but the thermostat is working?</h3>
<p>Many things can cause your AC to stop running, even if the thermostat is functioning normally. Shutdowns can be caused by clogged drain lines, very dirty air filters, tripped circuit breakers, faulty compressors, or blown capacitors.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you turn on your air conditioner but still don’t feel a chilly breeze coming from your vents, the fan motor may be to blame. In this guide, we’ll explore the top signs your fan motor is the cause behind your AC not blowing cold air, so you know when to book with <a href="https://www.callmedley.com/carrollton/air-conditioning/repair/">Medley for AC repair services</a>. </p>
<h2>What Does the Fan Motor Do in Your AC System?</h2>
<p>The fan motor moves air through your HVAC system and into the ductwork, helping regulate the temperature in your home. When your AC fan is not working, your air conditioner can’t distribute air, leading to uneven temperatures, poor airflow, and an uncomfortably hot house.</p>
<h3>Understanding the role of the fan motor</h3>
<p>The fan motor drives air across the evaporator coils and into your ductwork. It powers the blower fan to distribute this cool air through the duct and into your home. </p>
<h3>Types of fan motors</h3>
<p>Cooling systems contain two fan motors, which operate the blower and condenser. The blower motor operates inside your indoor unit to push cool air through your ductwork, while the condenser motor works outside to expel heat from the system.</p>
<p>These motors come in single-speed (on or off)  or variable-speed operations that change speed based on your cooling needs to provide more precise temperature control.</p>
<h2>Signs Your AC Fan Motor Might Be the Problem</h2>
<p>With your fan motor responsible for distributing air throughout your cooling system, it’s not surprising that it’s one of the most common culprits when airflow issues arise. Knowing the warning signs your air conditioner fan is not working helps you catch problems sooner, so you don’t have to deal with more costly repairs down the line.</p>
<h3>Common warning signs</h3>
<p>Some of the top indicators of fan motor troubles include:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">No air coming from the vents when the AC is on.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Your AC unit is making humming noises.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">The outdoor unit is running, but the indoor air handler is staying silent.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Overheating smells or short cycling.</li>
</ul>
<h3>How to tell it’s not something else</h3>
<p>The fan motor isn’t always to blame when your <a href="https://www.callmedley.com/blog/2021/june/why-is-my-air-conditioner-not-working-/">AC stops blowing air</a>. Check for the following to rule out other common problems:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">A dirty or clogged air filter</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Tripped circuit breakers</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Malfunctioning thermostat settings</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Blocked or closed vents</li>
</ul>
<h2>Can You Fix an AC Fan Motor Yourself?</h2>
<p>When it comes to fan motor repairs, it’s best to leave the job to the professionals. These components are wired into your system&#8217;s electrical network and often require specialized tools for removal and replacement. If you’re unsure whether the fan motor is the issue, you can perform a few tests to rule out other problems.</p>
<h3>Simple checks you can do</h3>
<p>Before calling in the pros, try these troubleshooting tips to see if you can get airflow back up and running:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Inspect for tripped breakers</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Check the thermostat for error codes or incorrect settings</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Carefully try spinning the AC fan blades to see if they activate</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.callmedley.com/blog/2023/march/it-s-time-for-spring-cleaning/">Clean the air filter</a> to rule out clogs or blockages</li>
</ul>
<h3>When to call a pro</h3>
<p>If the fan motor won’t turn on, you notice signs of capacitor or relay failure, or your AC is hot to the touch, skip the self-checks and contact <a href="https://www.callmedley.com/">the experts at Medley</a>. Our HVAC specialists have the tools and expertise to safely diagnose and repair the issue to restore cool comfort to your household.</p>
<h2>AC Fan Motor Repair or Replacement: What to Expect</h2>
<p>Knowing what to expect when you book an AC fan motor repair or replacement helps you prepare correctly and make informed decisions for your cooling system.</p>
<h3>Cost to replace an AC fan motor</h3>
<p>If your AC fan motor is severely damaged, replacement is often the most cost-effective solution. The model, part availability, labor rates, and the age of your HVAC unit determine your total bill. On average, you’ll pay between $300 and $600, but save on recurring <a href="https://www.callmedley.com/clear-cost-pricing/">repair costs</a> down the line. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Water stains on walls often point toward more serious underlying plumbing issues that require immediate professional attention. Whether you notice a small yellow patch or a large brown line spreading across your wall and ceiling, water stains could indicate hidden plumbing leaks that threaten your home’s structural integrity and your family’s health.</p>
<h2>Why Early Detection Matters</h2>
<p>A slow drip from a leaking pipe can create the perfect environment for mold and mildew to thrive. Water damage to wooden beams and other structural elements in your home is also possible. Addressing signs of water damage promptly helps prevent extensive damage and costly repairs.</p>
<p>In our experience serving Texas homeowners in <a href="https://www.callmedley.com/frisco/">Frisco</a>, Carrollton, Plano, and throughout the <a href="https://www.callmedley.com/service-area/">Dallas-Fort Worth area</a>, we’ve seen how ignored water stains on walls lead to significant structural problems. Professional leak detection services can spot and address these warning signs early, saving homeowners thousands in repairs. </p>
<h2>What Causes Water Stains on Walls?</h2>
<p>Many of the most common causes of water stains on walls involve hidden plumbing leaks.</p>
<h3>Common plumbing issues behind water stains</h3>
<p>The first signs of hidden plumbing leaks are often seemingly minor water stains on the walls of your home. These stains may result from:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Leaking pipes concealed within your walls</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Damaged or corroded water supply lines</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Loose or deteriorating connections between plumbing components</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Pressure building causing pipe joints to fail</li>
</ul>
<h3>External factors that contribute to water stains</h3>
<p>Noticing water stains doesn’t mean you need to call a professional for plumbing leak repair. Other factors can contribute to wall discoloration, including:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Roof leaks</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Poor drainage from gutters and other exterior features</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Condensation buildup from poor ventilation</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Window or door seal failures that allow moisture to collect</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Foundation issues affecting water drainage</li>
</ul>
<h2>Signs That Water Stains Indicate Bigger Plumbing Problems</h2>
<p>Recognizing the warning signs of water damage can help you identify serious plumbing issues before they cause extensive damage. </p>
<h3>Discoloration patterns and shapes</h3>
<p>Water stains on walls often appear yellow or brown due to the minerals in the water and their interaction with various building materials. The pattern and color of these stains may help you identify their possible sources.</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Circular patterns typically point toward an active plumbing leak point. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Streaking patterns suggest water flowing down from above and following a line.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Darkening colors often mean ongoing water exposure and chronic damage. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Additional warning signs to watch for</h3>
<p>Beyond visible stains, look for these indicators of serious hidden plumbing leaks and other issues:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Musty odors around the stained area</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Mold growth near the water stains</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Persistent dampness or moisture near the stain</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Peeling paint or bubbling wallpaper</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Warped or soft drywall</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Unexplained increases in water bills</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Risks of Ignoring Water Stains</h2>
<p>Protect your property’s value and your family’s well-being by understanding the risks of neglecting these important warning signs.</p>
<h3>Structural damage to your home</h3>
<p>Persistent moisture may weaken wall studs, undermine support beams, and break down drywall integrity. As water seeps deeper into the structure, it can affect flooring and even lead to foundation problems. </p>
<h3>Health risks from mold and mildew</h3>
<p>The damp environment created by water damage promotes mold and mildew growth. This affects the immediate area and can spread throughout your home. Prolonged mold exposure may lead to serious respiratory issues and allergic reactions. </p>
<h3>Escalating repair costs</h3>
<p>The longer a plumbing leak remains unchecked, the more extensive and expensive the repairs can become. What starts as a simple pipe repair can quickly evolve into wall replacement, structural repairs, and mold remediation. Investing in professional leak detection services helps prevent these costs from spiraling out of control.</p>
<h2>How Professional Leak Detection Can Help</h2>
<p>Modern leak detection services use technology to locate and identify plumbing problems without tearing your walls apart. </p>
<h3>Advanced techniques for finding hidden leaks</h3>
<p>Our skilled technicians use advanced, noninvasive diagnostic tools to pinpoint leak sources, saving time and preventing unnecessary damage.</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Thermal imaging cameras reveal temperature variations.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Moisture meters detect water activity behind walls.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Advanced acoustic listening devices pinpoint leak locations.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Benefits of hiring a leak detection expert</h3>
<p>Professional leak detection services provide peace of mind through minimal disruption to your home. Our experienced technicians quickly determine the extent of the issue. We’ll explain our findings and discuss possible plumbing leak repair options. This targeted approach prevents unnecessary wall removal and addresses the root cause of the problem. </p>
<h2>Steps To Take When You Notice Water Stains</h2>
<p>It’s important to take initial steps to limit damage and call a professional to promptly address signs of water damage.</p>
<h3>Immediate actions to prevent further damage</h3>
<p>If you spot water stains on walls in your home:</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Check for any visible signs of water, like a <a href="https://www.callmedley.com/blog/2024/october/clogged-drain-drain-rooter-services/">clogged drain</a> or leaking fixture.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Turn off the water supply to the area if you suspect a leak.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Dry the area around the stain to prevent mold growth.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Document the size and location of the stain by taking photos.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Contact a professional plumber for a full assessment. </li>
</ol>
<h3>When to call a professional</h3>
<p>Don’t hesitate to call the experienced team at Medley if you notice:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Stains that continue growing, which could indicate a persistent leak</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Multiple water stains in several areas</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Visible signs of mold, peeling paint, or bubbling wallpaper</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">A sudden increase in water bills</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Musty odors, especially near the water stains</li>
</ul>
<h2>Preventing Water Stains and Plumbing Issues</h2>
<p>There are several ways to prevent water stains and plumbing issues and protect your home from water damage.</p>
<h3>Routine plumbing maintenance</h3>
<p>Regular maintenance helps prevent leaks and water damage before they occur. Schedule annual plumbing inspections to address minor repairs, monitor water pressure levels, and check for loose connections or aging pipes. </p>
<h3>Upgrading your plumbing system</h3>
<p>Inspections may reveal opportunities to upgrade or replace plumbing components. For example, consider upgrading to a <a href="https://www.callmedley.com/blog/2024/february/the-pros-and-cons-of-tankless-water-heaters/">tankless water heater</a> for better efficiency, or replace old pipes with modern materials and install water monitoring systems to detect leaks early.</p>
<h3>Tips for homeowners</h3>
<p>Proactively protect your home from water damage by regularly inspecting walls, ceilings, and plumbing fixtures for signs of leaks. Monitor utility bills for unusual increases in water usage and take steps to maintain proper home ventilation. </p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3>Can a small leak cause water stains on walls?</h3>
<p>Yes. Even a pinhole leak in a pipe may release enough water over time to create visible stains on your walls. These small leaks can go unnoticed for a long time, allowing water damage to accumulate and mold to thrive behind your walls.</p>
<h3>Can water stains appear without visible leaks?</h3>
<p>Yes, water stains can appear before any visible signs of leakage. This happens because water can travel along pipes, studs, or other building materials before saturating drywall enough to show through. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pipe corrosion is a serious problem that occurs in homes with metal pipes and often leads to a decrease in water pressure. If you are experiencing low water pressure in </span><a href="https://www.callmedley.com/irving/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">your Irving, TX, home</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and suspect pipe corrosion is the culprit, give Medley Heating, Air Conditioning and Plumbing a call. Our plumbers will find the source of the problem and help you find the best, most cost-effective way to fix it. Medley offers </span><a href="https://pricing.callmedley.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">up-front pricing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.callmedley.com/financing/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">helpful financing options</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, so you know exactly what to expect without any surprise bills or add-ons. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Is Pipe Corrosion?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pipe corrosion occurs in metal pipes, making them more brittle until they eventually dissolve over time. The most common form of corrosion is rusting, which happens because of chemical reactions between the metal and the oxygen in the water (oxidation). Rusting results in plumbing pipe deterioration</span><b>,</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which can change the water pressure levels in your home. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How Pipe Corrosion Causes Low Water Pressure</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Corrosion is a problem that affects your water pressure due to the following reasons.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Build-up inside pipes</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the biggest</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">plumbing system issues caused by corrosion is sediment build-up. Rust flakes off over time and accumulates, often in turns and joints in the system, narrowing the pipes and restricting the water flow. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leaks from corrosion</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A pipe leak is one of the biggest culprits when it comes to</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">rusty pipes and water pressure drops. Rust eats away at the side of a pipe until the water can escape, lowering the pressure in your faucet or shower head.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blocked fixtures</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to flaking rust, your fixtures can become blocked, reducing the amount of water that can pass through. Over time, this problem noticeably affects your water pressure. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Signs Your Pipes May Be Corroded</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The following are some common signs your pipes are corroded.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Water quality changes</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pipe corrosion doesn’t just cause low water pressure — it can also cause other problems like changes in your water quality. You may notice discolored water, or it may smell or taste strange. If your water quality changes, it’s time to call a plumber. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Physical changes in pipes</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some signs of pipe corrosion</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">are visible from the outside. If you notice rusting, holes, or flaking in your pipes, you&#8217;ll likely need to replace your plumbing.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Water pressure symptoms</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Low water pressure is annoying, but it’s also a sign that there’s a problem in your pipes. It’s characterized by less water coming out of the tap or shower and a reduction in your toilet’s flushing capability.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Common Causes of Pipe Corrosion</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some of the most common reasons pipes corrode.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Water chemistry issues</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most common causes of low water pressure is corrosion. When metals oxidize, the sides rust and flake away, leading to holes in the pipes and clogs created by buildup.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aging plumbing systems</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Older pipes are more prone to breaking down, partially because they’re not made to handle modern water usage and because they’ve been exposed to oxygen and other elements for longer. Corrosion in galvanized pipes is dangerous. Over time, the protective zinc on the surface of the pipes breaks down and exposes the steel, which can rust and leach metals into your drinking and bathing water. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Environmental factors</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the water’s pH is acidic or the pipes carry hot water, they’ll be more likely to corrode. Certain types of bacteria or minerals in the water can also speed up the process. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How To Fix and Prevent Pipe Corrosion</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Common ways a plumber will fix and prevent pipe corrosion in your home include the following:</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Repairing corroded pipes</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plumbers can repair some corroded pipes by reinforcing damaged areas. Sometimes, simply replacing the pipe is often easier, more cost-effective, and will last longer.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upgrading to corrosion-resistant materials</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depending on the pipes and their use, your plumber may wish to upgrade them to stainless steel, PVC, or PEX pipes. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Preventative maintenance tips</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Homeowners can purchase a water softener to reduce minerals and acidic water from damaging pipes. Hiring a plumber to perform regular preventative maintenance and pipe cleaning helps prevent corrosion damage.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why Professional Help Is Essential for Corrosion-Related Issues</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not advisable for an amateur to try a DIY fix on corroded plumbing. A professional can help by doing the following.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Detecting hidden corrosion</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with low water pressure, some ways to know if your pipes are corroding include looking for leaks or damp spots in the walls and ceilings, flaky or rusty fixtures, strange-smelling or tasting water, and water discoloration. If you suspect your pipes are corroding, call Medley. We can find the source of the problem and fix the issue for you.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ensuring long-term solutions</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Medley, our plumbers are experienced in finding and fixing all manner of plumbing problems. They’ll locate the corroded areas and fix the issue using time-tested, lasting solutions. They’ll also replace the old pipes with new, corrosion-resistant piping, so you don’t have to worry.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Providing cost-effective early intervention</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If there’s a problem with your plumbing system, call your local expert plumbers today. The sooner you deal with the issue, the fewer problems you’ll have. If you leave corroding pipes too long, they may leak and cause water damage, mold, and serious structural issues.</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">FAQs About Pipe Corrosion and Water Pressure</span></h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Can pipe corrosion happen in all types of pipes?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, PEX and PVC pipes don’t corrode like metal pipes, making them a popular choice for many plumbing applications. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is pipe corrosion something that can be prevented?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have metal pipes, corrosion can’t be 100% prevented. Still, you can slow it down by using special coatings, minimizing the water velocity in the pipes, and keeping the water temperature below 180°F.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Can corroded pipes affect water quality?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes. Water that flows through corroded pipes will be discolored, or it may smell or taste strange. Certain contaminants, like copper and lead, are dangerous to your health, while other leached minerals simply change the water&#8217;s taste, appearance, or smell.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Will corroded pipes eventually cause leaks or bursts?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes. Over time, the sediment from the corrosion accumulates in the pipes, joints, or fixtures, causing them to leak or burst. This is especially true in areas with hard water, as more minerals will worsen the buildup.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Texas </span><a href="https://gov.texas.gov/film/page/agriculture_climate_geography#:~:text=The%20winters%20are%20fairly%20mild,and%2070's%20in%20the%20winter." target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">winters are generally mild</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, however, some parts of the state can see temperatures dip into the 20s. If your furnace continuously turns on and off, it’s likely doing something called “short cycling.” Don’t let furnace short cycling ruin your winter. The experienced technicians at Medley Heating, Air Conditioning, and Plumbing can solve your short cycling problems.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is Furnace Short Cycling?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Short cycling occurs when your furnace turns on and off frequently, increasing energy consumption and decreasing home comfort. There are several possible causes of furnace short cycling, and it can cause long-term damage if the problem is not addressed. Some of the causes are DIY repairs, while others require the help of a trained professional like the experienced </span><a href="https://pricing.callmedley.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">technicians at Medley</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Common Causes of a Furnace That Keeps Turning On and Off</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the underlying cause of a furnace that is short cycling varies, there are a few common reasons why this might occur.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dirty or clogged air filters</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A dirty or clogged air filter restricts airflow in your furnace and makes the system work harder and overheat. As a result, the unit may turn itself off as a safety measure to prevent system malfunction, resulting in short cycling. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once your system cools off, the system turns on again, and the cycle repeats. Understanding the </span><a href="https://www.callmedley.com/blog/2022/december/why-isnt-my-furnace-working/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cause of your furnace woes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is crucial to keep your system running smoothly. Fortunately, fixing clogged air filters in furnaces is simple – just replace the dirty, clogged filter with a new one. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Faulty thermostat</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A faulty thermostat can cause short cycling. Here are some of the main reasons why your thermostat might have issues:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The thermostat is not set to “heat” mode.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your thermostat could have faulty or damaged wiring.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A thermostat that is improperly calibrated will turn on and off until it’s fixed.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital thermostats with low or “dead” batteries will often malfunction.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thermostats placed near a heat source like a sunny window could give false readings and malfunction.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oversized furnace</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An oversized furnace will heat your home too quickly, causing the thermostat to turn the unit off. Once the temperature drops, it turns on again and repeats the cycle until you correct the issue. An experienced HVAC technician can perform a load calculation to ensure your furnace is appropriately sized for your home. Medley has </span><a href="https://www.callmedley.com/financing/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">flexible financing options</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> available to help you replace your oversized furnace with the correct size to save energy and money.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blower motor issues</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like a clogged filter, a dirty blower motor can restrict airflow, causing similar problems. If the furnace’s blower motor is broken or malfunctioning, it can also cause the system to short cycle. At Medley, we specialize in blower fan malfunction repairs to ensure that this important furnace component continues to work as it should. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dirty flame sensor</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have a gas furnace, a dirty </span><a href="https://www.callmedley.com/blog/2024/october/furnace-not-starting-flame-sensor/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">flame sensor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can cause short cycling since it may not detect the flame properly. This causes the furnace to shut off as a safety precaution, which results in short cycling. If you suspect any issues with your furnace’s flame sensor, contact Medley for prompt, reliable furnace repair services. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heat exchanger or limit switch problems</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A cracked or damaged heat exchanger can cause gases to leak and cause the unit to overheat and turn off. Dirt or debris clogging the heat exchanger will also lead to overheating, causing the limit switch to turn the unit off when it senses high temperatures. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heating Repair Solutions for a Short Cycling Furnace</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve done some heating system troubleshooting and think you know the cause, you can do some of these fixes on your own. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Replace or clean the air filter</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Check your furnace’s air filter frequently to ensure it’s clean and free of clogs. If it’s dirty, replace it with a new one. You should replace the furnace air filter every 30, 60, or 90 days per the manufacturer’s instructions to keep the airflow open and prevent overheating.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thermostat repairs or replacement</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A faulty thermostat may either need repair or replacement. A professional technician can inspect your thermostat to determine which option is best. Upgrading to a new thermostat can improve your furnace’s energy efficiency. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inspect and repair furnace components</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inspect your furnace components every fall for preventative maintenance. The sooner you can identify and repair or replace faulty components, the better your system will run, and you’ll prevent more costly </span><a href="https://www.callmedley.com/heating/furnace-repair/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">repairs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Evaluate furnace size and efficiency</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re not sure whether your current furnace is appropriately sized, contact the Medley team. We’ll assess your system and determine whether it’s best to have your furnace replaced to improve efficiency. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Preventing Furnace Short Cycling in the Future</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some ways you can prevent furnace short cycling in the future to keep your system running smoothly. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regular maintenance</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regular preventative maintenance is one of the best ways to prevent your furnace from short cycling. Maintenance should include regular inspections, tune-ups, and other measures like changing the air filter. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proper thermostat use</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure your thermostat is set to the right temperature and that it’s turned to the “heat” setting. A programmable thermostat is a great way to save energy and keep it set to the right temperature based on your needs. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monitor air quality</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you notice an increase in dust or other airborne particles, it could indicate an issue with your furnace. Carefully monitor the indoor air quality in your home, especially when the furnace is on. If something seems “off,” it might be time to call for a furnace inspection.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uneven heating can make it hard to stay </span><a href="https://www.callmedley.com/blog/2020/november/a-tribute-to-cozy-beyond-furnace-tune-ups/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cozy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but installing a modern furnace can eliminate warm and cold spots at home. Otherwise, inconsistent temperatures can make it difficult to sleep or enjoy a </span><a href="https://www.callmedley.com/blog/2023/september/prep-your-home-for-football-watch-parties-/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">football watch party</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Replacing your furnace before it gives out may seem unnecessary. However, modern heating systems run more smoothly and are more adaptable. Read on to learn why having Medley upgrade your furnace can help achieve more even and efficient heating.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Why Uneven Heating Happens</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uneven heating can occur for several reasons. These are some of the most common causes of </span><a href="https://www.callmedley.com/carrollton/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hot and cold spots in homes in Carrollton</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Aging/Outdated Furnace</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Heating systems become less effective as they age. The absence of modern technology can also play a role.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>The Furnace Is the Wrong Size</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The unit may have not been sized properly when installed or, if you’ve expanded your home, it might not have the power to provide enough heat.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Poor Airflow</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Restricted airflow, whether caused by a faulty blower motor, blocked vents, or other issues, can prevent your furnace from delivering enough warm air.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Lack of Zoning</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Without zoning in larger and multi-level homes, an old unit may be unable to transport enough heat to warm the entire space.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inconsistent temperature control can also contribute to uneven heating, as can a lack of features that address temperature and airflow regulation. On top of these, high energy consumption increases utility costs, so the extra expenses can go towards purchasing a modern furnace.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Key Features of Modern Furnaces That Address Uneven Heating</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several aspects of modern furnace systems contribute to more consistent heating. These are some of the features that improve furnace and </span><a href="https://www.callmedley.com/blog/2022/june/what-is-the-best-hvac-system-in-texas-/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HVAC system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> performance and efficiency:</span></p>
<h3><strong>Variable-Speed Blower Motors</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A variable-speed motor uses an inverter to adjust its speed depending on the heating output needed. More precise control allows for consistent comfort around your home. It also improves energy efficiency since your heating unit runs smoothly and only at the required level.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Multi-Stage Heating Systems</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A single-stage system operates at only one speed. Instead of running at just full capacity, a multi-stage heating system can operate at different capacities. A two-stage unit is the most basic type, but variable-speed furnaces operate between 25% and 100% of full capacity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Variable output allows the unit to consume less power and control temperatures to within half a degree.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Zoning Systems</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A zoning system can optimize temperature control for different parts of your home. It requires installing dampers in your air ducts or vents and placing thermostats in each room or area you want zoned heating. Some systems can be managed via a centralized control panel. Zoning is ideal for multi-level homes or when occupants have different heating preferences.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Smart Thermostats and Controls</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most modern furnaces are compatible with smart thermostats. These allow more precise temperature management by monitoring sensors around your home. The thermostat can also learn your usage habits and be controlled remotely via your smartphone or other Wi-Fi-connected device.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Benefits of Upgrading to a Modern Furnace</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upgrading your furnace provides access to the latest features. It also has numerous benefits, such as:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Improved Comfort</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: A modern furnace eliminates cold spots as it’s better at maintaining even temperatures. It also improves airflow so your home is more comfortable.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Energy Efficiency</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: High-efficiency furnaces can reduce your utility bills significantly. A heating unit’s Annual Fuel Utilization Efficiency (AFUE) measures how well it converts fuel to heat; a high-efficiency unit has a 90% AFUE or higher.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Reduced Environmental Impact</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Modern furnaces produce fewer greenhouse gas emissions; eco-friendly heating helps make your home more sustainable.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Increased Home Value</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Upgrading your HVAC system can make your home more appealing to potential buyers. Advanced heating technology is one improvement that can help increase resale value.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>When Should You Upgrade Your Furnace?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Medley, we’re committed to helping you make an informed decision. Replacing your furnace is not an easy choice, especially when your older one still works. However, the following considerations can help you decide when it’s time for an upgrade: </span></p>
<h3><strong>Signs Your Furnace Is Causing Uneven Heating</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frequent cold spots</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uneven heating</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">High energy bills</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inconsistent airflow</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Noisy operation</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Age and Efficiency of Your Furnace</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A furnace typically lasts around 15 to 20 years if you maintain it properly. But even with good maintenance, components inside your furnace start to wear out. It may then distribute air less effectively, leading to uneven heating.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Repair vs. Replacement</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A furnace repair can cost hundreds of dollars; a major repair can cost over $1,000. The more frequently the unit requires fixing, the more cost-effective it is to buy a new one. This is also true if a repair costs over 50% of the price of a replacement. It also avoids the inconvenience and cost of dealing with future issues.</span></p>
<h2><strong>How to Choose the Right Furnace for Your Home</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve decided to invest in a modern furnace, choosing the right one is essential. The most important factors to consider include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The right furnace size for your home’s square footage.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zoning, variable-speed motors, multi-stage heating, and other modern features.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AFUE ratings and Energy Star certification.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s also important to hire a certified HVAC professional for furnace installation. They can help choose the right type and sized heating unit. In addition, they’re equipped with the tools and materials to install it properly. Combined with system testing and calibration, this ensures optimal performance throughout the unit’s lifespan (you can also depend on your local heating contractor for maintenance and upkeep, which helps it continue to run smoothly and efficiently).</span></p>
<h3><strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>Why Is Consistent Heating Important?</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uneven temperatures can affect your physical health by exacerbating cold symptoms and chronic conditions such as asthma or arthritis. They can also contribute to stress and poor sleep quality. Consistent heating is not only good for your health but also for your indoor air quality and the energy efficiency of your home.</span></p>
<h3><strong>How Do I Know My Furnace Is Causing Uneven Heating?</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the problem is with your furnace, the unit may be short cycling, or turning on and off more frequently. An aging furnace may also be less effective at heating rooms farther away from it. Hiring a professional to troubleshoot and inspect it can determine if a replacement is the best uneven heating solution.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Can I Fix Uneven Heating Without Replacing My Furnace?</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depending on the unit’s condition, you can replace the filters more often, keep the fan at “On” instead of “Auto”, or schedule maintenance to address the issue. Installing a programmable thermostat can help adjust the heating level to your needs. A licensed contractor can help decide on the best option, whether it involves a simple modification or a new </span><a href="https://www.callmedley.com/heating/furnace-installation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">furnace installation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
