<h1 class="wp-block-heading">System Restoration: Breathe New Life into Your HVAC in Carrollton</h1>



<p>System restoration is like a hard reset for your HVAC. With attention to the indoor unit, drainage system care, and condenser unit restoration, our services at Medley go deeper than routine maintenance to revitalize and overhaul your HVAC system.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What is System Restoration?</h3>



<p>Designed to rejuvenate your HVAC, system restoration addresses a range of components to improve AC efficiency and longevity. It goes beyond the usual checks and adjustments of a standard AC tune-up, instead aiming to rectify underlying problems contributing to performance decline or breakdowns.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Benefits of HVAC system restoration</h3>



<p>Regular wear, environmental conditions, and outdated technology gradually decrease HVAC efficiency. HVAC restoration, however, offers numerous benefits to help you get more from your system, such as lower energy bills, reduced wear, and an extended lifespan.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Condenser Unit Restoration: Keeping Your Cool</h3>



<p>As the outdoor part of your&nbsp;<a href="https://www.callmedley.com/air-conditioning/">AC system</a>, the condenser is prone to dirt and debris accumulation that may lead to reduced performance or breakdowns. In some cases, a replacement is necessary when the cost of a failed compressor outweighs the cost of a new unit, though you can avoid a costly replacement by restoring or upgrading condenser components.</p>



<p>A failing motor causes overheating, reduced efficiency, and even complete system failure. If it has mechanical issues or fails altogether, replacing the condenser fan motor&nbsp;can make a big impact on your AC’s performance.</p>



<p>Other condenser restoration tasks may include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Capacitor replacement: </strong>Capacitors store and release energy to kickstart the compressor and fan motor — when it fails, your system can’t start. Replacing a faulty capacitor is a relatively minor fix that can make a big difference between a functional or failing system.</li>



<li><strong>Compressor contactor replacement: </strong>Compressor contactors regulate the flow of electricity. Replacing a faulty contactor helps minimize the risk of surges or fluctuations that may damage your system and lead to more costly repairs.</li>



<li><strong>Compressor start assist: </strong>An optional add-on to your system, a start assist provides extra power to your compressor when it kicks on, helping it get up to speed faster and easing strain on components.</li>



<li><strong>Deep cleaning: </strong>Professional deep cleaning removes dust and debris that may hinder your system’s efficiency from the condenser coil and other areas.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Drainage System Care: Preventing Water Damage</h3>



<p>HVACs have drainage systems that remove water extracted from the air and direct it outside. Without maintenance, drainage systems may cause water damage, high indoor humidity, frozen evaporator coils, mold, and other signs suggesting increased strain and wear on your system.</p>



<p>Preventing water damage involves either cleaning or replacing the condensate drain pan, AC drain line cleaning, drain modification, or installing flood protection. If your technician finds buildup and clogs in your drainage system, they can deep clean the pan and drain line, remediating rust from the pan and unclogging the line if necessary.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Indoor Unit Attention: Optimizing Airflow and Comfort</h3>



<p>AC revitalization services rejuvenate indoor unit components to optimize airflow, improve efficiency, and reduce AC noise.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">AC air filter</h3>



<p>The AC air filter is an essential part that maintains indoor air quality by removing most debris and other particles before entering the indoor unit. Filters require replacement every 1 to 3 months depending on usage. The right air filter should be compatible with your specific AC model.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Leaks</h3>



<p>Cracks, leaks, corrosion, and defects in your system can cause numerous problems for your AC that reduce its efficiency and lifespan. For instance, leaks may cause uneven or insufficient cooling and heating throughout your home and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.energystar.gov/saveathome/heating-cooling/duct-sealing/benefits" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lower efficiency by 20% or more</a>. Our technicians can use lifetime sealant, a specialized adhesive, to seal joints and connections in your HVAC system.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Blower motor replacement</h3>



<p>The blower motor circulates air throughout your home — without a functioning blower, your system can’t properly heat or cool your home or&nbsp;improve air quality. Deep cleaning is often the first step if your blower motor isn’t working as it should, but a failed motor typically needs replacement altogether.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Evaporator coil cleaning</h3>



<p>Dirt, corrosion, and debris buildup on the evaporator coil impede the heat exchange process and can lead to freezing, leaks, excessive condensation, and other problems. Using a specialized process, your technician can carefully deep clean your evaporator coil to restore it to proper efficiency.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Furnace maintenance</h3>



<p>Restoring a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.callmedley.com/heating/">furnace</a>&nbsp;helps ensure its performance, safety, and longevity. Restoration services may include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Gas valve replacement</li>



<li>Ignitor replacement</li>



<li>Flame sensor cleaning</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Understanding the Warranty and Exclusions</h3>



<p>HVAC equipment generally comes with a manufacturer warranty, which generally covers faulty components, compressor failure, and other problems related to defects in materials. If your HVAC equipment is still under warranty, your policy may cover the replacement of certain parts.</p>



<p>Owner neglect, improper maintenance, modifications, and others may violate the warranty as per its requirements, leaving you responsible for repair and replacement costs.</p>



<p>Even if you’re no longer covered by warranty, restoration services help return your system to proper function by addressing worn parts, poor installation, and other problems, saving you the cost of a full system replacement.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Is AC System Restoration Right for Me?</h3>



<p>Routine tune-ups keep your system running smoothly ahead of each cooling season, but they’re not always adequate for major wear or other concerns. If your HVAC frequently breaks down, is inefficient, or otherwise isn’t working as it should, a system restoration helps reset it. Restoration minimizes the strain that worn or damaged components may cause to each other, potentially saving on repair and premature replacement costs.</p>

<p>Here are some things to consider if you’re wondering when to call us for heating system emergency services.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Signs you need emergency heater repair</h3>



<p>These are some signs that you may need to search for “24/7 heater repair near me”:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Your heater won’t turn on or respond.</li>



<li>The heating system is blowing cold air or heating your home unevenly.</li>



<li>You hear loud or unusual screeching, rattling, or banging noises.</li>



<li>You notice the smell of gas or other unusual odors.</li>



<li>There’s no heat in your home during periods of extreme cold weather.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Common heater problems requiring emergency service</h3>



<p>Some of the most common problems that indicate you need our local emergency furnace repair include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Pilot light issues: </strong>If your pilot light is discolored (yellow or orange instead of blue) or won’t stay lit, it should be addressed by a professional ASAP.</li>



<li><strong>Blower motor failure: </strong>If your heater is running but not distributing warm air, it could be due to a malfunctioning blower motor.</li>



<li><strong>Thermostat issues: </strong>When you adjust the thermostat, but the heater doesn’t respond, it’s likely a thermostat-related issue. </li>



<li><strong>Overheating: </strong>If your furnace shuts down frequently or emits a burning smell, it’s likely overheating and needs attention. </li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How do we handle heater emergencies?</h3>



<p>At Medley, we provide fast response times, so you don’t have to wait in the cold. We also provide thorough troubleshooting and diagnostics to ensure we make the most accurate repairs possible.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">AC Emergencies: Restoring Comfort During Heatwaves</h2>



<p>Dealing with a broken AC in the summer is frustrating. Here are some tips to help you restore comfort during heatwaves and when you may need our emergency AC repair services.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Signs you need emergency AC repair</h3>



<p>Look for these signs that indicate you need emergency AC repair:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Your air conditioning isn’t cooling the air, or it’s blowing warm air.</li>



<li>The AC unit is making unusual and/or loud humming or grinding noises.</li>



<li>You notice water leaking from the air conditioner.</li>



<li>The system suddenly shuts off or won’t turn on at all.</li>



<li>The coils are frozen or you notice excessive ice buildup on the unit.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Common AC problems requiring emergency service</h3>



<p>If your AC isn’t working, don’t open the windows. This could make the problem worse because it’s more difficult for the system to cool the indoor air once warm air from the outside enters your home.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here are some common AC problems that typically require emergency service:&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Refrigerant leak: </strong>If your AC has low refrigerant or is leaking refrigerant, it can’t cool your home efficiently.</li>



<li><strong>Compressor issues: </strong>If the AC won’t turn on or can’t cool your home effectively, it could be due to an issue with the compressor.</li>



<li><strong>Electrical problems: </strong>The circuit breaker may trip whenever your AC starts, indicating a problem with your electrical wiring or connection to the AC unit.</li>



<li><strong>Fan malfunctions: </strong>When the AC fan won’t spin or operates inconsistently, it should be repaired or replaced. </li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How do we handle AC emergencies?</h3>



<p>Once you call us, we’ll arrive quickly to inspect and repair your home’s central AC or mini-split ductless system. We’re experts at resolving pressing AC issues like refrigerant leaks, frozen coils, electrical problems, and more.</p>



<p>After we make repairs, we’ll make sure your AC is performing optimally before we leave your home. If your AC stops working during a heatwave, change the air filter, check your circuit breaker, and call us immediately if the problem isn’t resolved.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Importance of Addressing HVAC Emergencies Promptly</h2>



<p>If you suspect a problem with your home’s HVAC system, it’s important to address the emergency promptly. Ignoring HVAC problems can lead to costly repairs or replacements and may lead to further damage.</p>



<p>When you address the issue quickly, you protect your home and family from safety risks like a dangerous gas leak, electrical fire, or overheating. Plus, prompt repairs help you maintain the comfort inside your home by keeping temperatures at a reasonable level and your HVAC functioning during critical times.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Tips for Preventing HVAC Emergencies</h2>



<p>Here are some helpful tips to prevent HVAC emergencies:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Get regular maintenance: </strong>Schedule seasonal inspections and tune-ups for your heater and air conditioner. Good preventative maintenance helps you identify issues early before they turn into breakdowns or costly repairs.</li>



<li><strong>Keep things clean: </strong>Replace air filters per the manufacturer’s instructions, and clean your HVAC components regularly to maximize airflow.</li>



<li><strong>Know the warning signs: </strong>Recognize and address early warning signs like unusual noises, odors, or performance issues before they escalate into a breakdown.</li>



<li><strong>Practice proper system usage: </strong>Set your thermostat at a reasonable level and avoid overusing your system. Consider investing in a programmable thermostat to maximize energy efficiency.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Comprehensive air conditioner tune-up checklist</h3>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Signs Your AC Needs Maintenance</h2>



<p>Not sure whether you need to schedule maintenance? Learn when your AC needs expert HVAC care.</p>

<li>Ice forming on the coils or refrigerant lines.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Benefits of a preventative maintenance plan</h3>



<p>Just like any other machine, your air conditioner undergoes a good amount of wear and tear, which, over&nbsp;time,&nbsp;leads&nbsp;to issues with your system. Regular AC maintenance helps minimize wear and tear, as well as AC issues, big and small.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How long does an AC maintenance appointment take?</h3>



<p>A typical AC maintenance call takes between one and two hours on average, but the total length of time depends on the complexity of your system.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Can I do AC maintenance myself, or should I hire a professional?</h3>



<p>Some maintenance — like changing a filter — is fine to do yourself. However, in most cases, hiring an HVAC expert is safer. Doing AC maintenance work yourself could damage the system or void your warranty.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What’s the difference between an AC tune-up and an AC repair?</h3>



<p>Tune-ups are routine maintenance, such as cleaning and inspecting a system that’s functioning normally, while a repair fixes an already existing problem.&nbsp;</p>

<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Air Conditioner Installation/Replacement in Carrollton, TX</h1>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Upgrade Your Comfort with a New AC System</h3>



<p>A properly functioning air conditioning system helps to maintain the comfort in your home or business in Carrollton, TX. The summer heat can reach the high 90s, leading to hot and muggy interiors, especially if your current system is outdated and inefficient.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A new air conditioning system installation will provide numerous benefits, especially peace of mind. Medley Heating, Air Conditioning &amp; Plumbing is the trusted solution when scheduling your&nbsp;air conditioning installation/replacement.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Schedule your AC installation service with Medley Heating, Air Conditioning &amp; Plumbing today;&nbsp;</strong><a href="tel:4698874874"><strong>call (469) 887-4874</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;or reach us online using our secure&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://www.callmedley.com/contact-us/"><strong>contact form</strong></a><strong>.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why Install or Replace Your AC System?</h2>



<p>A&nbsp;<a href="https://www.callmedley.com/air-conditioning/">well-installed air conditioning system</a>&nbsp;keeps your indoor environment cool, helps improve air quality, and increases energy efficiency. If yours isn’t doing so good, it’s time to look at a modern replacement.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Benefits of a new AC installation</h3>



<p>There are several significant advantages of upgrading to a new AC unit, including:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Improved energy efficiency</li>



<li>Long-term cost savings</li>



<li>Advanced cooling technology</li>



<li>Avoiding inconvenient breakdowns&nbsp;</li>



<li>Improved filtration and ventilation features</li>



<li>Smart thermostats compatibility</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Signs you need an AC replacement&nbsp;</h3>



<p>The decision to replace your air conditioner can be a difficult one. That said, there are some sure signs you need an AC replacement, such as:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>An aging unit:&nbsp;</strong>Your AC unit is 10-15 years old and showing signs of wear and tear.</li>



<li><strong>Frequent repairs:&nbsp;</strong>Frequent breakdowns and rising maintenance costs indicate an aging system.</li>



<li><strong>Poor climate control:&nbsp;</strong>Uneven cooling with noticeable hot and cold spots throughout your home.</li>



<li><strong>Inefficient energy use:&nbsp;</strong>Higher energy bills due to a decrease in efficiency.</li>



<li><strong>Bad refrigerants:&nbsp;</strong>Your system uses the outdated refrigerant (chlorofluorocarbons), which are being phased out.</li>
</ul>



<p>If your air conditioner is 10-15 years old and still working, yet you have a high energy bill, this is a sign that it is too old for a fix-all repair.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Choosing the right AC system for your home</h3>



<p>Selecting the right AC system involves several factors, but using the knowledge of a licensed technician makes it easy. Our technicians will guide you through the process, determine the right size for your home, and explain the ins and outs of AC system selection, including the different&nbsp;<a href="https://www.energystar.gov/products/central_air_conditioners" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio (SEER) ratings</a>.</p>



<p>Regardless of your decision, Medley only works with top HVAC brands known for their longevity and performance. The last step is picking the appropriate size for your home to avoid energy waste.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What to Expect During an AC Installation</h2>



<p>Here is a step-by-step guide for what to expect with a typical AC installation with Medley:</p>



<p><strong>Step one:</strong>&nbsp;Evaluation and recommendation of your home’s cooling needs by a Medley technician.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Step two:</strong>&nbsp;Removal and disposal of your outdated unit.</p>



<p><strong>Step three:</strong>&nbsp;Installation of a new AC unit with a thermostat and any necessary ductwork modifications.</p>



<p><strong>Step four</strong>: Testing of the new AC system to determine if it is running efficiently and meets cooling expectations.</p>



<p><strong>Step five:&nbsp;</strong>Explanation of how to operate and maintain your new AC system for optimal performance.</p>



<p>To guarantee an AC replacement consultation goes smoothly, plan to be available for a full day and check that all areas close to the electrical panels and ductwork are cleared of furniture.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How long does an AC installation take?</h3>



<p>A standard AC Installation is typically completed within 4 to 8 hours, though a full system replacement with new ductwork can take a day or two, depending on the complexity. Your home size, system type, and any required extra modifications all impact the duration of the installation.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Energy-Efficient Air Conditioning Options</h2>



<p>If you are looking for an energy-efficient AC, seek out a SEER of 16 or higher. High SEER-rated units may be a bit more expensive, but the long-term savings on your utility bill outweigh their cost. Units with variable-speed compressors also improve cooling efficiency by adjusting output as needed and are usually quieter.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Smart thermostat integration&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Smart, Wi-Fi-enabled thermostats allow remote temperature control and energy monitoring and are compatible with Nest, Ecobee, and Honeywell smart home systems. Smart thermostats provide optimized cooling schedules, reduce energy consumption, and enhance comfort.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Common Air Conditioning Problems Medley Repairs</h2>



<p>As your local HVAC repair company, we’re here to help with your air conditioning issues. With <s>Carrollton summer temperatures</s> climbing into the mid–90s at times, you’ll want to make sure your AC is running smoothly. Here are some common AC problems we repair.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">AC not cooling properly</h3>



<p><em>“Why is my AC not cooling?”</em> is the number one question we get, and it’s no doubt one of the most frustrating issues to deal with. If you’ve noticed your AC blowing warm air (or not blowing much at all), there are a few potential causes.</p>



<p>An AC not cooling properly may be due to low refrigerant, which may mean the unit needs refrigerant leak repair. Another possibility is that the coils have become dirty or your compressor is failing. We offer comprehensive AC compressor repair services, coil cleaning, and more. Once we’ve pinpointed the issue, we’ll recharge refrigerant, clean coils, or repair failing components, helping you cool off sooner.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Weak airflow from vents</h3>



<p>Another common air conditioning repair job we take on is repairing weak airflow from vents. Poor AC airflow is often caused by blocked filters, duct problems, or fan malfunctions. After our expert diagnosis, we’ll get to work cleaning components, replacing parts, and inspecting the duct for any other issues.</p>
