<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Reasons for a new sink installation</h3>

Large cracks, deep stains, rust, and generally worn components typically require replacement.&nbsp;</p>

If needed, they’ll disconnect and remove the existing sink before replacing. Installation involves mounting the sink, attaching the drain and P-trap, and connecting the water lines.</li>



<li><strong>Inspection: </strong>The plumber tests the sink to ensure proper flow, drainage, and functionality. They’ll walk you through your repaired or newly-installed sink.</li>

<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Emergency Plumbing in Carrollton, TX</h1>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Plumbing Services When You Need It Most</h3>



<p>Medley offers a wide array of emergency plumbing services. When you need help repairing sudden plumbing failures, our team provides fast and expert services.</p>



<p><strong>Call&nbsp;<a href="tel:4698874874"><strong>(469) 887-4874</strong></a>&nbsp;for emergency plumbing services in Carrollton, TX.</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What Qualifies as a Plumbing Emergency?</h2>



<p>A plumbing emergency involves issues that have potential to significantly damage your home or threaten your household health and safety. Minor problems are inconvenient but don’t usually warrant an emergency repair — left unaddressed, however, leaks, corrosion, or other problems can eventually escalate into an emergency. Common plumbing emergencies include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Broken or burst pipes</li>



<li>Frozen pipes</li>



<li>Sewer line backups</li>



<li>Clogged drains</li>



<li>Broken water heater</li>



<li>Gas leaks</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Our Comprehensive Emergency Plumbing Services</h2>



<p>At Medley, our plumbing team provides a range of emergency&nbsp;<a href="https://www.callmedley.com/plumbing/">plumbing services</a>&nbsp;designed to address and resolve urgent problems. Whether you’re dealing with a burst pipe or clogged sink drain, our team of skilled plumbers is ready to assist.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Burst pipe repairs</h3>



<p>Burst pipes typically result from freezing temperatures, high water pressure, aging pipes, and other circumstances. Sudden water pressure loss and unexplained puddles may signal a burst pipe, potentially one obscured behind your walls. Without urgent attention, flooding from burst pipes causes water damage, sagging ceilings, peeling or bubbling paint, ruined subfloors, mold, and even structural damage.</p>



<p>Our team will arrive with professional tools and equipment for burst pipe repair. We’ll walk you through the repair process and suggest next steps to mitigate damage and safety hazards.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Clogged drains and sewer backups</h3>



<p>Slow drains can suddenly become full blockages, sometimes causing one or more backups throughout your home. Medley specializes in fast and long-term fixes for clogged drains, such as:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Clogged sink drain repair</li>



<li>Sewer line restoration</li>



<li>Tree root removal</li>



<li>Drain cleaning</li>



<li>Augering</li>



<li>Hydro-jetting</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Water heater emergencies</h3>



<p>A malfunctioning water heater can cause major disruptions to your household routine and may even lead to flooding or fire hazards. Corrosion, rust, loose connections, sediment buildup, ignition or power system faults, and other problems may result in unexpected breakdowns and often require immediate attention to avoid further damage or inconvenience.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Leaking or overflowing toilets</h3>



<p>Whether from a clog deep in your system or a problem with the components, a leaking or overflowing toilet creates unsanitary messes, flooding and water damage, and wasted water. If plunging your toilet isn’t enough, switch off the water and contact an emergency plumber for overflowing toilet repairs.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Gas leak detection and repairs</h3>



<p>Gas leaks are dangerous and require immediate professional attention. Symptoms of a gas leak may include a rotten egg or sulfuric smell, hissing noises, dying plants, and high gas bills. Gas may also result in physical symptoms, such as headaches, nausea, breathing problems, and more. If you suspect a gas leak, evacuate your household and contact a gas leak emergency plumber.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Signs You Need Emergency Plumbing Services</h2>



<p>Knowing when to call a local plumber for emergency repair can prevent minor problems from quickly escalating and causing severe and costly damage.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Warning signs</h3>



<p>Here are the warning signs that you need emergency plumbing services:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Water stains: </strong>Discolored spots on your walls or ceilings suggest leaks.</li>



<li><strong>Loss of water pressure: </strong>A sudden drop in water pressure may indicate a severe leak or burst pipe. This symptom is even more urgent if it affects multiple fixtures.</li>



<li><strong>Puddles and pooling water:  </strong>Water pooling around your sink, toilet, water heater, or other appliances and fixtures is a clear sign of underlying plumbing issues.</li>



<li><strong>Sewage smells: </strong>Unpleasant odors from your drains or faucets suggest bacterial overgrowth or blockages in your plumbing system.</li>



<li><strong>Gurgling sounds: </strong>Gurgling sounds from your toilet, faucets, or drains point to trapped air from a blockage in the system. This can cause pressure buildup that may cause burst pipes or backups.</li>



<li><strong>Rotten egg smells: </strong>Manufacturers add chemicals to otherwise odorless natural gas that create smells similar to sulfur or rotten eggs so you can smell when you have a natural gas leak.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Why timing matters</h3>



<p>For plumbing emergencies, timing is often the difference between simple repairs and major damage requiring costly restorations. Leaks and clogs may initially seem minor, but left unresolved, they lead to water damage, mold, and structural damage. Slow-draining sinks can lead to complete clogs or backflows, triggering a chain of escalating issues with your plumbing system.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">FAQs About Piping and Repiping Services</h3>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Can you repair leaking or corroded pipes, or do they need to be replaced?</h3>



<p>It depends on the damage to the pipe, but in many cases, it’s better to replace a damaged pipe than try to patch it up.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What causes pipes to burst, and how can I prevent it?</h3>



<p>Common causes of burst pipes include increased water pressure due to clogs, temperature changes cracking the pipe, or thin areas of the pipe giving way due to corrosion. Prevent these issues by scheduling ongoing preventative maintenance with a local plumber near you. Avoid putting hair, oils, and food down the drain, and skip harsh cleaning products that worsen corrosion.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What should I do if I notice a sudden drop in water pressure?</h3>



<p>Check for obvious clogs, determine whether the problem is localized to one area or the entire house, and then call a plumber. Your water pressure may have dropped for multiple reasons, but if it’s a burst pipe, you’ll want to take care of it right away.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Why is my water discolored or smelling bad?</h3>



<p>Discolored or smelly water may occur due to spring runoff, but if it’s a new issue, it could be caused by corroding copper pipes or materials entering a crack in your plumbing. A professional plumber can help you find the root of the issue and fix it.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What causes noisy pipes, and how can they be fixed?</h3>



<p>You may hear banging, humming, or vibration sounds if you have high water pressure, air in the pipes, or clogged pipes. A Medley plumber will identify the sound and its origin and fix the issue for you.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Frequently Asked Questions</h3>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How do I know if my toilet needs replacement?</strong></h3>



<p>While some toilets last 50 years or more, most require replacement after 10 to 15 years. Several signs suggest your toilet is ready to retire, such as frequent issues due to worn or broken parts. Certain types of damage may also justify a new toilet, such as visible cracks in the toilet’s bowl, tank, or base. Outdated toilets are often inefficient and waste water when they flush, while modern options come with various efficiency measures.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Leaking toilet</li>



<li>Frequently clogged toilet</li>



<li>Flushing issues</li>



<li>Loose toilet handle</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How can I prevent future toilet problems?</strong></h3>



<p>Prevent future toilet headaches with these tips for proper care and maintenance:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Proper disposal: </strong>Only flush human waste and toilet paper. Avoid flushing feminine products, diapers, cotton balls, swabs, paper towels, or other paper-based materials.</li>



<li><strong>Regular cleaning: </strong>Clean the toilet regularly to prevent bowl and rim clogs. Consistent cleaning reduces the effort required and keeps the toilet in good condition.</li>



<li><strong>Check for leaks: </strong>Inspect your toilet for leaks regularly, and address them promptly by scheduling a repair.</li>



<li><strong>Use water softeners: </strong>Hard water can lead to pipe blockages and damage toilet components. Invest in a water softener to remove harsh minerals and prolong the toilet’s lifespan.</li>



<li><strong>Avoid harsh products:</strong> Opt for gentle toilet cleaners. Harsh cleaners can damage the pipes, leading to leaks or bursts that are costly to fix.</li>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Types of Leaks We Detect</h3>



<p>Many homeowners face challenges with leaks throughout their homes. Leaks can appear anywhere in your plumbing system, whether from your plumbing pipes hidden in your walls or those buried beneath your home. Medley specializes in detecting various residential leaks to help keep your home safe and your plumbing system running smoothly.</p>



<p>Whether a visible or hidden leak, we offer detection for numerous types of leaks. These include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Pipe leaks </li>



<li>Slab leaks</li>



<li>Ceiling leaks</li>



<li>Wall leaks</li>



<li>Toilet leaks</li>



<li>Ceiling leaks</li>



<li>Faucet leaks</li>



<li>Underground leaks</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Leak Detection Process</h3>



<p>The Medley plumbing team aims for efficient and precise leak detection to minimize disruption to your home. Your plumber starts by learning more about your concerns, such as water stains or other warning signs, and carefully inspects your plumbing system to identify the leak and its underlying cause. If your leak is hidden, they’ll likely employ non-invasive technology to find water leaks obscured behind your walls, beneath your floors, or elsewhere.</p>



<p>Once we’ve located the source of the leak, we’ll provide you with a detailed report and estimate of the necessary repair. Most water leak detections only take a few hours depending on where they’re located, and repairs vary based on the nature of the problem.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Leak detection methods</strong></h3>



<p>Advanced plumbing tools allow our team to locate the exact location of leaks without causing unnecessary damage to your home. Here are common leak detection methods:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Acoustic leak detection: </strong>Acoustic methods use specialized sensors to listen for sounds associated with leaks.</li>



<li><strong>Thermal imaging cameras: </strong>Thermal cameras scan obscuring structures in your home for temperature patterns indicating moisture, with colder areas indicating potential leaks.</li>



<li><strong>Video pipe inspection: </strong>High-resolution cameras attached to a flexible cable feed into your pipes and transit live footage to the plumber.</li>



<li><strong>Pressure testing: </strong>These tests involve filling your system with pressurized air or water. Pressure drops usually confirm a leak.</li>



<li><strong>Ground penetrating radar: </strong>This technology sends radar waves into the ground to highlight abnormal signs associated with leaks. </li>



<li><strong>Ultrasonic leak detection: </strong>Sound waves pick up high-frequency sounds created by escaping water. Plumbers analyze the sounds to determine the leak location.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>When you need leak detection services</strong></h3>



<p>Our leak detection services help you identify factors contributing to plumbing problems, and recognizing these factors can help you take preventative measures against undetected water leaks in your home. Regular maintenance and professional inspection of your plumbing system can help nip potential issues in the bud before they escalate into more severe problems.</p>



<p>Common water leak causes include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Corrosion: </strong>Hard water, high flow velocity, bacteria, and other factors contribute to pipe corrosion over time, resulting in small leaks that might go unnoticed until substantial damage occurs. </li>



<li><strong>High water pressure:</strong> Excessive pressure can cause pipes to crack or burst.</li>



<li><strong>Temperature changes:</strong> Temperature fluctuations make pipes expand and contract, causing cracks and subsequent leaks over time. </li>



<li><strong>Tree roots:</strong> Roots can infiltrate and crack your pipes, especially in older homes with porous clay pipes more prone to root intrusion. </li>



<li><strong>Poor installation:</strong> Improperly installed pipes or fixtures can leak at the joints where they connect to other pipes, a common issue in older homes with outdated plumbing standards. </li>



<li><strong>Old age:</strong> Even highly durable pipe materials wear out over time and may develop leaks.</li>



<li><strong>Clogged drains:</strong> A blocked drain may result in high pipe pressure and lead to leaks.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Benefits of Professional Leak Detection</h3>



<p>Left unaddressed, leaks can lead to significant, irreversible, and costly damage to your home’s key structures. Many obscured leaks damage your home before you notice signs, so hiring a professional enables early detection and therefore minimizes impact.</p>



<p>Since leaks can waste&nbsp;<a href="https://www.epa.gov/watersense/fix-leak-week" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10,000 gallons of water</a>&nbsp;per home each year, early leak detection and repair also saves on water bill costs. In addition to providing precise results, minimally invasive detection strategies also prevent unnecessary excavation or demolition and associated repair costs.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Signs You May Have a Leak</h3>



<p>Swift response is the best way to minimize leak impacts. Call Medley for assistance if you notice these signs:</p>

<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Tankless Water Heater Service in Carrollton</h1>

At Medley Heating, Air Conditioning &amp; Plumbing, we offer a wide range of tankless water heater services in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.callmedley.com/service-area/">Carrollton and surrounding areas</a>.</p>

Keep reading to discover why we’re the go-to choice for Texas homeowners.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What Is a Tankless Water Heater?</h3>



<p>A&nbsp;<a href="https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/tankless-or-demand-type-water-heaters" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tankless water heater</a>, also known as an on-demand water heater, heats water as needed. Unlike traditional water heaters, which store and heat a large amount of water in a tank, tankless water heaters&nbsp;don’t&nbsp;have a storage tank. Instead, they use a powerful heat exchanger to heat water as it passes through the unit,&nbsp;providing&nbsp;a continuous supply regardless of how much you use.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Benefits of Tankless Water Heaters</h3>



<p>Some of the&nbsp;top&nbsp;benefits&nbsp;you’ll see after installing&nbsp;a tankless water heater include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Endless hot water:</strong> Because tankless heaters heat water as needed, they can provide a continuous hot water supply. No matter how many people use it simultaneously, you’ll never run out.</li>



<li><strong>Energy savings: </strong>Tankless water heaters are much more energy-efficient than traditional water heaters because they don’t have to store a large amount of heated water. Instead, they only heat water as it is needed, helping you save a significant amount on your energy bills.</li>



<li><strong>Space savings:</strong> Traditional hot water heaters are large and bulky, taking up a lot of space in your home. Tankless water heaters, on the other hand, are small and compact. They can be installed on the wall, which can help you save a significant amount of space.</li>



<li><strong>Longer lifespan:</strong> Compared to traditional water heaters, which typically last about 10 years, tankless water heaters can last for up to 20. You won’t have to replace your water heater as often, helping you save a significant amount of money in the long run.</li>
</ul>

<li><strong>Tankless water heaters: </strong>These energy-efficient models heat water on demand without a storage tank.</li>



<li><strong>Heat pump water heaters: </strong>These systems use heat pump technology to heat your water, pulling hot water from the surrounding air and transferring it to heat water in a storage tank.</li>

<li><strong>Water heater noises: </strong>Popping, banging, or other sounds may indicate sediment buildup or faulty components.</li>

<li><strong>High energy bills: </strong>Strangely high energy bills may stem from your water heater working inefficiently due to an underlying problem.</li>



<li><strong>Discolored water: </strong>Rust-hued water indicates sediment or corrosion in the tank, which sometimes forewarns tank deterioration and failure.</li>



<li><strong>Aging system: </strong>If your water heater is over 15 years old and experiencing frequent or costly malfunctions, replacement is often the most cost-effective solution.</li>

Our team expertly installs all types of modern, more energy-efficient kitchen and bathroom plumbing fixtures to ensure a smooth remodel or home renovation.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Fixture repair</h3>



<p>Medley deals with both plumbing fixture repair and replacement, but&nbsp;it’s not always clear&nbsp;which option you need.&nbsp;Our&nbsp;experienced&nbsp;plumbers&nbsp;will help you determine which option is right for you. When deciding whether to repair or replace your fixtures, consider its&nbsp;age,&nbsp;current condition, expected lifespan,&nbsp;and the&nbsp;potential&nbsp;for higher&nbsp;costs&nbsp;later. If&nbsp;more damage or leaks may occur&nbsp;soon, we recommend a replacement rather than a repair depending on what we find during the diagnosis and inspection&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Fixture replacement</h3>



<p>Your&nbsp;plumbing fixtures&nbsp;undergo&nbsp;normal wear and tear over time. While minor&nbsp;issues&nbsp;can be fixed with a simple repair, more extensive problems may require&nbsp;you to&nbsp;<strong>replace plumbing fixtures.</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Maintenance and upgrades</h3>



<p>We recommend getting regular preventative maintenance to keep your plumbing fixtures in good condition. These maintenance tasks include regularly checking your fixtures for leaks, cleaning your drains, and cleaning tub faucets and showerheads to keep water flowing smoothly.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Signs You Need Plumbing Fixture Services</h2>



<p>While some plumbing fixture issues are obvious, others might not be so easy to spot. It’s important to know the signs that may mean you need to contact us for professional plumbing fixture services.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Common indicators</h3>



<p>Here are some common indicators that you need expert plumbing fixture services:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Strange noises: </strong>While some noises coming from your plumbing are normal, unusual knocking or sputtering sounds are a clear signal that there’s a problem with your pipes or fixtures. These noises may indicate a loose valve, loose supports, or a broken component inside the fixture.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Dripping: </strong>If your faucet is constantly dripping, it needs attention right away. Not only is this wasting water, but it might be due to a more serious problem.</li>



<li><strong>Low water pressure:</strong> If you notice low water pressure whenever you turn on your faucet or shower, it could be due to a clog in the faucet or showerhead, or a more serious problem that requires the help of an experienced plumber as soon as possible. </li>
</ul>

<p>Upgrading your plumbing fixtures can make your bathroom or kitchen more functional and provide additional benefits, too.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Frequently Asked Questions About Drain and Rooter Services</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What causes multiple drains in my home to clog at the same time?</h3>



<p>Intrusive tree roots, hair, food, non-biodegradable foreign objects, or grease buildup can cause multiple drains in your home to clog at the same time. A broken pipe or mineral buildup may also cause several clogs to occur at once.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What is the difference between drain cleaning and Rooter services?</h3>



<p>Drain cleaning typically involves removing a clog from a single drain using a snake or other plumbing tools. Rooter services utilize more complex techniques like hydrojetting, tree root removal, or trenchless sewer repair.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How do trenchless sewer repair options work for damaged pipes?</h3>



<p>Trenchless sewer repair fixes cracked or collapsed pipes without having to dig the earth around them or your home’s foundation to access them. This technology may use a special liner or epoxy coating to repair the pipes from the inside, or it may require bursting a pipe while simultaneously replacing the broken section with a new one remotely.</p>
