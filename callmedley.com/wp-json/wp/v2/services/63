A broken pipe or mineral buildup may also cause several clogs to occur at once.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is the difference between drain cleaning and Rooter services?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Drain cleaning typically involves removing a clog from a single drain using a snake or other plumbing tools. Rooter services utilize more complex techniques like hydrojetting, tree root removal, or trenchless sewer repair.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How do trenchless sewer repair options work for damaged pipes?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Trenchless sewer repair fixes cracked or collapsed pipes without having to dig the earth around them or your home\u2019s foundation to access them. This technology may use a special liner or epoxy coating to repair the pipes from the inside, or it may require bursting a pipe while simultaneously replacing the broken section with a new one remotely.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Trust Medley Heating, Air Conditioning &amp; Plumbing for all your drain cleaning needs in Carrollton, TX.
