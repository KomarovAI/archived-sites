New plumbing, countertop modifications, and other tasks can add complexity and time to the installation. Your plumber can provide you with an approximate timeline based on their assessment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How can I prevent sink clogs?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Regular maintenance is the best way to prevent sink clogs. Avoid disposing of grease, food scraps, and anything other than water or mild, plumbing-safe cleaners down your sink drains. Periodically run hot water to clear out debris, and use a drain screen to catch debris.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Do you provide emergency sink repair services?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Medley offers emergency plumbing services, which include urgent sink concerns such as severe leaks or blockages.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Call&nbsp;<a href=\"tel:4698874874\"><strong>(469) 887-4874<\/strong><\/a>&nbsp;today to schedule an appointment with our Carrollton sink replacement team!<\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Sink Repair &amp; Installation in Carrollton, TX Providing Quality Sink Services Sinks are among your home\u2019s most important and relied-upon equipment.
