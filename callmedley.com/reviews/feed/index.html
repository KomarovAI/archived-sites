<p>If you are looking for a reputable, honest heating/air conditioning company, look no further than Medley Heating and Air Conditioning. My experiences with this company have been very positive. Staff keeps you informed as to arrival times, all work done very professionally keeping me informed as to their findings with my air conditioner. I’ve asked them to return in the fall for a check up on furnace system. I highly recommend Medley Heating and Air Conditioning.</p>

<p>Can’t say enough good things about our recent experience with Medley Heating &amp; Air. A couple of weeks back, the AC unit at our house stopped working and we were left with an 80+ degree house. After a negative experience with another company, we took a chance with Medley and are so thankful we did. Despite being a Sunday, Tex (the owner) was willing to come out to our home and take a look at our system. Throughout the day, he was responsive and thorough. We also appreciated his transparency in what options made the most sense for us. After determining replacement was our best option, Tex and his team even came out to our house again that night to get the replacement done! We came back the next morning and had a nice cool home again. For any AC needs we may have in the future, our first call will definitely be to Medley Heating &amp; Air!</p>

<p>We highly recommend Medley Heating and Air Conditioning – I was amazed at how quickly they responded in getting us scheduled and Texas got our AC going that afternoon. He was not only very professional and courteous – he shared his knowledge about our system so that we could plan for the future and gave us tips on how to reduce our energy bill<br></p>

<p>Just had Medley install new AC / Heating units &amp; ducts. Did it all in one day. Although fast, they took the time to make sure the install was neat, clean and operating properly. Thank you Taylor, Monte &amp; Jeremiah…you did a great job.</p>

<p>Texas and the crew treat you like family. They are very responsive, always willing to go the extra mile to help, and are very professional. They have the best customer experience, follow through, and attention to detail around. You would be hard pressed to find another company with this type of character and dedication to customers.</p>

<p>Medley Heating &amp; AC is a top-notch, honest and reliable company! They installed my new heater and updated my ducts recently. I also use them for my semi-annual maintenance. The customer service that both Texas and Taylor provide is nothing short of superior. I would recommend them to anyone needing HVAC service. You will not be disappointed.<br></p>
